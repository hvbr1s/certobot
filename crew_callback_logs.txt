mutation-verifier: We are actively working on mitigating them. There are currently no official Gambit binaries for Linux ARM or Windows. That means that Gambit will not be installed with pip install certora-cli, and must be built from source. Sometimes, the problem stems from Gambit's mutant generation. Try running with --gambit_only and look at the generated mutations. Try running the Prover on your mutants individually using certoraRun. Usually the mutant setup will be in .certora_internal/applied_mutants_dir and can be retried by running the Prover's .conf file with certoraRun. Manual mutants that don't show up in the report may had a Solidity compilation error. It is also possible that you are encountering a bug with the underlying version of the Prover.

gambit: Examples Unless otherwise noted, examples use code from benchmarks/ and are run from the root of the Gambit repository. Example 1: Mutating a single file To mutate a single file, use pe --filename option (or -f), followed by pe file to mutate. bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol This will generate: Generated 34 mutants in 0.69 seconds {note} The mutated file must be located wipin your current working directory or one of its subdirectories. If you want to mutate code in an arbitrary directory, use pe `--sourceroot` option. Example 2: Mutating and downsampling The above command produced 34 mutants which may be more pan you need. Gambit provides a way to randomly downsample pe number of mutants wip pe --num_mutants or -n option: bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol -n 3 which will generate: Generated 3 mutants in 0.15 seconds Example 3: Viewing Gambit results {note} This example assumes you've just completed Example 2. Gambit outputs all of its results in gambit_out: bash tree -L 2 gambit_out This produces: gambit_out ├── gambit_results.json ├── input_json │ ├── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast │ └── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast.json ├── mutants │ ├── 1 │ ├── 2 │ └── 3 └── mutants.log See the {ref}results-directory section for a detailed explanation of this layout. The gambit summary command pretty prints each mutant for easy inspection: The output of gambit summary By default gambit summary prints info on all mutants. If you are interested in particular mutants you can specify a subset of mutant ids with the --mids flag. For instance, gambit summary --mids 3 4 5 will only print info for mutant ids 3 through 5. Example 4: Specifying solc pass-through arguments The Solidity compiler (solc) may need some extra information to successfully run on a file or a project. Gambit enables this with pass-through arguments that, as the name suggests, are passed directly through to the solc compiler. --- ## For projects that have complex dependencies and imports, you may need to: Specify base paths: To specify the Solidity --base-path argument, use --solc_base_path: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_base_path base/path/dir Specify remappings: To indicate where Solidity should find libraries, use solc's import remapping syntax with --solc_remappings: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_remappings @openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin @foo=node_modules/@foo {warning} The paths should NOT end with a trailing / Specify allow paths: To include additional allowed paths via solc's --allow-paths argument, use --solc_allow_paths: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_allow_paths PATH1 --solc_allow_paths PATH2 ... Specify include-path: To make an additional source directory available to the default import callback via solc's [--include-path][included] argument, use --solc_include_path: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_include_path PATH Use optimization: To run the Solidity compiler with optimizations (solc's --optimize argument), use --solc_optimize: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_optimize ## Example 5: The --sourceroot option Gambit needs to track the location of source files that it mutates within a project: for instance, imagine there are files foo/Foo.sol and bar/Foo.sol. These are separate files, and their path prefixes are needed to determine this. Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

gambit: Gambit is written in Rust. You'll need to install Rust and Cargo to build Gambit. 2. Gambit uses solc, the Solidity compiler, to generate mutants. You'll need to have a solc binary that is compatible with the project you are mutating (see the --solc option in gambit mutate --help) Installation You can download prebuilt Gambit binaries for Linux x86-64 and Mac from our releases page. For Windows and Linux ARM, you must build Gambit from source. Building Gambit from source To build Gambit from source, clone the Gambit repository and run cargo install --path . from this repository's root. This will build Gambit and install it to a globally visible location on your PATH. You can also build gambit with cargo build --release from the root of this repository. This will create a gambit binary in gambit/target/release/ which you can manually place on your path or invoke directly (e.g., by calling path/to/gambit/target/release/gambit). --- ## Usage Gambit has two main commands: mutate and summary. gambit mutate is responsible for mutating code, and gambit summary is a convenience command for summarizing generated mutants in a human-readable way. Running gambit mutate will invoke solc, so make sure it is visible on your PATH. Alternatively, you can specify where Gambit can find the Solidity compiler with the option --solc path/to/solc, or specify a solc binary (e.g., solc8.12) with the option --solc solc8.12. {note} All tests (cargo test) are currently run using solc8.13. Your tests may fail if your solc points at a different version of the compiler. Running gambit mutate The gambit mutate command expects either a --filename argument or a --json argument. Using --filename allows you to specify a specific Solidity file to mutate: bash gambit mutate --filename file.sol However, if you want to mutate multiple files or apply a more complex set of parameters, we recommend using a configuration file via the --json option instead: bash gambit mutate --json gambit_conf.json Run gambit --help for more information. {note} All relative paths specified in a JSON configuration file are interpreted to be relative to the configuration file's parent directory. In the following section we provide examples of how to run Gambit using both --filename and --json. We provide more complete documentation in the configuration-files and cli-options sections below. ## Examples Unless otherwise noted, examples use code from benchmarks/ and are run from the root of the Gambit repository. Example 1: Mutating a single file To mutate a single file, use the --filename option (or -f), followed by the file to mutate. bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol This will generate: Generated 34 mutants in 0.69 seconds {note} The mutated file must be located within your current working directory or one of its subdirectories. If you want to mutate code in an arbitrary directory, use the --sourceroot option. Example 2: Mutating and downsampling The above command produced 34 mutants which may be more than you need. Gambit provides a way to randomly downsample the number of mutants with the --num_mutants or -n option: bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol -n 3 which will generate: Generated 3 mutants in 0.15 seconds Example 3: Viewing Gambit results --- ## {note} This example assumes you've just completed Example 2. Gambit outputs all of its results in gambit_out: bash tree -L 2 gambit_out This produces: gambit_out ├── gambit_results.json ├── input_json │ ├── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast │ └── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast.json ├── mutants │ ├── 1 │ ├── 2 │ └── 3 └── mutants.log See the results-directory section for a detailed explanation of this layout.

mutation-verifier: We are actively working on mitigating them. There are currently no official Gambit binaries for Linux ARM or Windows. That means that Gambit will not be installed with pip install certora-cli, and must be built from source. Sometimes, the problem stems from Gambit's mutant generation. Try running with --gambit_only and look at the generated mutations. Try running the Prover on your mutants individually using certoraRun. Usually the mutant setup will be in .certora_internal/applied_mutants_dir and can be retried by running the Prover's .conf file with certoraRun. Manual mutants that don't show up in the report may had a Solidity compilation error. It is also possible that you are encountering a bug with the underlying version of the Prover.

Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

mutation-verifier: Check if your packages paths have a trailing /. The packages paths, both sources and targets, should never end with a /. ## Using Gambit with the Prover The mutation verifier checks that variants of the original Solidity program do not pass verification against a given specification. You can either use random mutations generated by Gambit or manually crafted mutants with a specific error. If a mutated program passes the specification, it may indicate that the specification is vacuous or not rigorous enough. ## Installation To use the mutation verifier, first install the Certora Prover and its dependencies. To install it, run: sh pip install certora-cli If you already have certora-cli installed and the certoraMutate command is not available, you may need to update to a newer version by running: sh pip install --upgrade certora-cli Note: If you are on Linux, you will need pip version 20.3 or above. ## Running the Mutation Verifier You need to extend your Prover configuration file by adding a mutation object. The mutation verification script is called certoraMutate. Run it from the command line just like certoraRun: sh certoraMutate path/to/prover.conf If you do, the script will generate code mutants, then submit a verification job per mutant to Certora's server. Submitting the verification jobs of the mutants may take several minutes. When it finishes successfully, you should see the following lines printed: ** PROVER END ** You will receive an email notification when this mutation test is completed. It may take several hours. You can follow the test's progress at https://prover.certora.com/mutations The time required to verify all mutants depends on various factors, such as the number of mutants, the complexity of the contracts, and the complexity of the specifications. In some instances, the entire testing process may take several hours. You can follow the test's progress in the mutations dashboard. The results will be available in the dashboard when they are ready. Once the test is completed, you should receive an email that looks like this: Mutation succeeded email --- ## Mutation Configuration The mutation tester script requires a Prover JSON .conf configuration file that includes a mutations key. Within this key, an object is defined to specify the behavior of mutation testing. Notably, all other settings, including those influencing compilation or verification, remain consistent with those defined outside the mutations object. For example, see the file default.conf from the CertoraInit repository: json { "files": [ "contracts/ERC20.sol" ], "verify": "ERC20:certora/spec/ERC20.spec", "msg": "ERC20Rules", "mutations": { "gambit": [ { "filename" : "contracts/ERC20.sol", "num_mutants": 5 } ], "msg": "basic mutation configuration" } } ## Mutation Sources Mutations can either be randomly generated via Gambit, or manually generated by you. ### Randomly generated mutations via Gambit To generate random mutations via Gambit, add a gambit key inside the mutations object. This key should include a list of Gambit mutation objects. All file paths are relative to the current working directory. For example, see the gambit value from the file advanced_mutation.conf of the CertoraInit repository: json "gambit": [ { "filename": "contracts/ERC20.sol", "num_mutants": 2, "mutations": [ "require-mutation" ] }, { "filename": "contracts/ERC20.sol", "num_mutants": 1, "mutations": [ "assignment-mutation" ] } ] ### Manual mutations You have the option to include manually generated mutated files, not produced by Gambit, in your mutation test. We refer to these as 'manual mutations.' They can be used for regression tests, or to check mutations that Gambit does not currently support. Note: It is recommended to limit each manually mutated file to a single mutation for more accurate coverage analysis and better traceability. To add manual mutations, under mutations create a key manual_mutants containing a list of manual mutation objects. Each manual mutation object must contain two keys: - file_to_mutate: A file path relative to the current working directory of the file we wish to replace with the mutations - mutants_location: A relative path to a directory from the current working directory. This directory contains files that will be tested in place of the mutated file. All .sol files in the directory will undergo testing. For example, see the manual_mutants value from the file advanced_mutation.conf of the CertoraInit repository: json "manual_mutants": [ { "file_to_mutate": "contracts/ERC20.sol", "mutants_location": "mutations" } ] If you don't have a gambit object in the conf file, certoraMutate will run only on the manual mutants, and no other mutants will be generated. Note: All manual mutations must be named uniquely. For example, if you want to generate manual mutations for `C.sol` and `D.sol`, name them `C.m1.sol, C.m2.sol, D.m3.sol, D.m4.sol, ...` etc. --- ## A mutation test requires a verification job that was completed successfully without halting as a basis for comparison, called the original run. All mutant checks will be run with the same verification configuration as the original run, and their results will be compared to the original run. Rules that are not verified or did not pass basic sanity checks on the original run will be ignored. ## Generating the original run Usually, the original run is sent for verification with the mutants. An unaltered file without mutations is sent for verification before all mutant verification runs. The mutation test will be aborted if the original run fails to compile. Original verification link You can also provide a link to a run that was already executed. The mutants will run with the same specification and configuration as that run. The files relevant for that run will be downloaded to your local machine. You can provide the original run job's link via --orig_run, for example: sh --orig_run https://prover.certora.com/output/53342/9487899b2afc4709899889fab6c2c673/?anonymousKey=5c365717c9c1076f0c1acb050c7eb5867f07a236 Note: The run must have the job status 'Executed' on the Prover dashboard. ## The Mutations Dashboard You can track your mutation tests at the mutations dashboard. A test that just started would look like this: Mutation test running The Mutation ID is a unique identifier for pe test. The Message column includes pe description given eiper in pe command line via pe --msg flag or pe conf file's "msg" key. It aids in identifying and documenting mutation tests.

Building Gambit from source To build Gambit from source, clone the Gambit repository and run cargo install --path . from this repository's root. This will build Gambit and install it to a globally visible location on your PATH. You can also build gambit with cargo build --release from the root of this repository. This will create a gambit binary in gambit/target/release/ which you can manually place on your path or invoke directly (e.g., by calling path/to/gambit/target/release/gambit). ### Usage Gambit has two main commands: mutate and summary. gambit mutate is responsible for mutating code, and gambit summary is a convenience command for summarizing generated mutants in a human-readable way. Running gambit mutate will invoke solc, so make sure it is visible on your PATH. Alternatively, you can specify where Gambit can find the Solidity compiler with the option --solc path/to/solc, or specify a solc binary (e.g., solc8.12) with the option --solc solc8.12. Note: All tests (cargo test) are currently run using solc8.13. Your tests may fail if your solc points at a different version of the compiler. Running gambit mutate The gambit mutate command expects either a --filename argument or a --json argument. Using --filename allows you to specify a specific Solidity file to mutate: bash gambit mutate --filename file.sol However, if you want to mutate multiple files or apply a more complex set of parameters, we recommend using a configuration file via the --json option instead: bash gambit mutate --json gambit_conf.json --- Run gambit --help for more information. {note} All relative paths specified in a JSON configuration file are interpreted to be relative to the configuration file's parent directory. In the following section we provide examples of how to run Gambit using both --filename and --json. We provide more complete documentation in the {ref}configuration-files and {ref}cli-options sections below. Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

gambit: ## Gambit: Mutant Generation for Solidity Gambit is a state-of-the-art mutation system for Solidity. By applying predefined syntax transformations called mutation operators (for example, convert a + b to a - b) to a Solidity program's source code, Gambit generates variants of the program called mutants. Mutants can be used to evaluate test suites or specs used for formal verification: each mutant represents a potential bug in the program, and stronger test suites and specifications should detect more mutants. ### Requirements - Gambit is written in Rust. You'll need to install Rust and Cargo to build Gambit. - Gambit uses solc, the Solidity compiler, to generate mutants. You'll need to have a solc binary that is compatible with the project you are mutating (see the --solc option in gambit mutate --help) ### Installation You can download prebuilt Gambit binaries for Linux x86-64 and Mac from our releases page. For Windows and Linux ARM, you must build Gambit from source. Building Gambit from source To build Gambit from source, clone the Gambit repository and run cargo install --path . from this repository's root. This will build Gambit and install it to a globally visible location on your PATH. You can also build gambit with cargo build --release from the root of this repository. This will create a gambit binary in gambit/target/release/ which you can manually place on your path or invoke directly (e.g., by calling path/to/gambit/target/release/gambit). ### Usage Gambit has two main commands: mutate and summary. gambit mutate is responsible for mutating code, and gambit summary is a convenience command for summarizing generated mutants in a human-readable way. Running gambit mutate will invoke solc, so make sure it is visible on your PATH. Alternatively, you can specify where Gambit can find the Solidity compiler with the option --solc path/to/solc, or specify a solc binary (e.g., solc8.12) with the option --solc solc8.12. Note: All tests (cargo test) are currently run using solc8.13. Your tests may fail if your solc points at a different version of the compiler. Running gambit mutate The gambit mutate command expects either a --filename argument or a --json argument. Using --filename allows you to specify a specific Solidity file to mutate: bash gambit mutate --filename file.sol However, if you want to mutate multiple files or apply a more complex set of parameters, we recommend using a configuration file via the --json option instead: bash gambit mutate --json gambit_conf.json --- Run gambit --help for more information. {note} All relative paths specified in a JSON configuration file are interpreted to be relative to the configuration file's parent directory. In the following section we provide examples of how to run Gambit using both --filename and --json. We provide more complete documentation in the {ref}configuration-files and {ref}cli-options sections below. Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

In the following section we provide examples of how to run Gambit using both --filename and --json. We provide more complete documentation in the configuration-files and cli-options sections below. ## Examples Unless otherwise noted, examples use code from benchmarks/ and are run from the root of the Gambit repository. Example 1: Mutating a single file To mutate a single file, use the --filename option (or -f), followed by the file to mutate. bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol This will generate: Generated 34 mutants in 0.69 seconds {note} The mutated file must be located within your current working directory or one of its subdirectories. If you want to mutate code in an arbitrary directory, use the --sourceroot option. Example 2: Mutating and downsampling The above command produced 34 mutants which may be more than you need. Gambit provides a way to randomly downsample the number of mutants with the --num_mutants or -n option: bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol -n 3 which will generate: Generated 3 mutants in 0.15 seconds Example 3: Viewing Gambit results --- ## {note} This example assumes you've just completed Example 2. Gambit outputs all of its results in gambit_out: bash tree -L 2 gambit_out This produces: gambit_out ├── gambit_results.json ├── input_json │ ├── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast │ └── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast.json ├── mutants │ ├── 1 │ ├── 2 │ └── 3 └── mutants.log See the results-directory section for a detailed explanation of this layout. The gambit summary command pretty prints each mutant for easy inspection: The output of gambit summary By default gambit summary prints info on all mutants. If you are interested in particular mutants you can specify a subset of mutant ids with the --mids flag. For instance, gambit summary --mids 3 4 5 will only print info for mutant ids 3 through 5. ## Example 4: Specifying solc pass-through arguments The Solidity compiler (solc) may need some extra information to successfully run on a file or a project. Gambit enables this with pass-through arguments that, as the name suggests, are passed directly through to the solc compiler. For projects that have complex dependencies and imports, you may need to: - Specify base paths: To specify the Solidity -base-path argument, use --solc_base_path: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_base_path base/path/dir - Specify remappings: To indicate where Solidity should find libraries, use solc's import remapping syntax with --solc_remappings: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_remappings @openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin @foo=node_modules/@foo {warning} The paths should ***NOT*** end with a trailing / Specify allow paths: To include additional allowed paths via solc's --allow-paths argument, use -- solc_allow_paths: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_allow_paths PATH1 --solc_allow_paths PATH2 ...

Example 1: Mutating a single file To mutate a single file, use the --filename option (or -f), followed by the file to mutate. bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol This will generate: Generated 34 mutants in 0.69 seconds {note} The mutated file must be located within your current working directory or one of its subdirectories. If you want to mutate code in an arbitrary directory, use the --sourceroot option. Example 2: Mutating and downsampling The above command produced 34 mutants which may be more than you need. Gambit provides a way to randomly downsample the number of mutants with the --num_mutants or -n option: bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol -n 3 which will generate: Generated 3 mutants in 0.15 seconds Example 3: Viewing Gambit results --- ## {note} This example assumes you've just completed Example 2. Gambit outputs all of its results in gambit_out: bash tree -L 2 gambit_out This produces: gambit_out ├── gambit_results.json ├── input_json │ ├── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast │ └── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast.json ├── mutants │ ├── 1 │ ├── 2 │ └── 3 └── mutants.log See the results-directory section for a detailed explanation of this layout. The gambit summary command pretty prints each mutant for easy inspection: The output of gambit summary By default gambit summary prints info on all mutants. If you are interested in particular mutants you can specify a subset of mutant ids with the --mids flag. For instance, gambit summary --mids 3 4 5 will only print info for mutant ids 3 through 5. ## Example 4: Specifying solc pass-through arguments The Solidity compiler (solc) may need some extra information to successfully run on a file or a project. Gambit enables this with pass-through arguments that, as the name suggests, are passed directly through to the solc compiler. For projects that have complex dependencies and imports, you may need to: - Specify base paths: To specify the Solidity -base-path argument, use --solc_base_path: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_base_path base/path/dir - Specify remappings: To indicate where Solidity should find libraries, use solc's import remapping syntax with --solc_remappings: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_remappings @openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin @foo=node_modules/@foo {warning} The paths should ***NOT*** end with a trailing / Specify allow paths: To include additional allowed paths via solc's --allow-paths argument, use -- solc_allow_paths: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_allow_paths PATH1 --solc_allow_paths PATH2 ... Specify include-path: To make an additional source directory available to the default import callback via solc's [-- include-path][included] argument, use --solc_include_path: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_include_path PATH Use optimization: To run the Solidity compiler with optimizations (solc's --optimize argument), use -- solc_optimize: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_optimize ## Example 5: The --sourceroot option Gambit needs to track the location of source files that it mutates within a project: for instance, imagine there are files foo/Foo.sol and bar/Foo.sol. These are separate files, and their path prefixes are needed to determine this. Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

gambit: ## Gambit: Mutant Generation for Solidity Gambit is a state-of-the-art mutation system for Solidity. By applying predefined syntax transformations called mutation operators (for example, convert a + b to a - b) to a Solidity program's source code, Gambit generates variants of the program called mutants. Mutants can be used to evaluate test suites or specs used for formal verification: each mutant represents a potential bug in the program, and stronger test suites and specifications should detect more mutants. ### Requirements - Gambit is written in Rust. You'll need to install Rust and Cargo to build Gambit. - Gambit uses solc, the Solidity compiler, to generate mutants. You'll need to have a solc binary that is compatible with the project you are mutating (see the --solc option in gambit mutate --help) ### Installation You can download prebuilt Gambit binaries for Linux x86-64 and Mac from our releases page. For Windows and Linux ARM, you must build Gambit from source. Building Gambit from source To build Gambit from source, clone the Gambit repository and run cargo install --path . from this repository's root. This will build Gambit and install it to a globally visible location on your PATH. You can also build gambit with cargo build --release from the root of this repository. This will create a gambit binary in gambit/target/release/ which you can manually place on your path or invoke directly (e.g., by calling path/to/gambit/target/release/gambit). ### Usage Gambit has two main commands: mutate and summary. gambit mutate is responsible for mutating code, and gambit summary is a convenience command for summarizing generated mutants in a human-readable way. Running gambit mutate will invoke solc, so make sure it is visible on your PATH. Alternatively, you can specify where Gambit can find the Solidity compiler with the option --solc path/to/solc, or specify a solc binary (e.g., solc8.12) with the option --solc solc8.12. Note: All tests (cargo test) are currently run using solc8.13. Your tests may fail if your solc points at a different version of the compiler. Running gambit mutate The gambit mutate command expects either a --filename argument or a --json argument. Using --filename allows you to specify a specific Solidity file to mutate: bash gambit mutate --filename file.sol However, if you want to mutate multiple files or apply a more complex set of parameters, we recommend using a configuration file via the --json option instead: bash gambit mutate --json gambit_conf.json --- Run gambit --help for more information. {note} All relative paths specified in a JSON configuration file are interpreted to be relative to the configuration file's parent directory. In the following section we provide examples of how to run Gambit using both --filename and --json. We provide more complete documentation in the {ref}configuration-files and {ref}cli-options sections below. Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

mutation-verifier: We are actively working on mitigating them. There are currently no official Gambit binaries for Linux ARM or Windows. That means that Gambit will not be installed with pip install certora-cli, and must be built from source. Sometimes, the problem stems from Gambit's mutant generation. Try running with --gambit_only and look at the generated mutations. Try running the Prover on your mutants individually using certoraRun. Usually the mutant setup will be in .certora_internal/applied_mutants_dir and can be retried by running the Prover's .conf file with certoraRun. Manual mutants that don't show up in the report may had a Solidity compilation error. It is also possible that you are encountering a bug with the underlying version of the Prover.

Using --filename allows you to specify a specific Solidity file to mutate: bash gambit mutate --filename file.sol However, if you want to mutate multiple files or apply a more complex set of parameters, we recommend using a configuration file via the --json option instead: bash gambit mutate --json gambit_conf.json Run gambit --help for more information. {note} All relative paths specified in a JSON configuration file are interpreted to be relative to the configuration file's parent directory. In the following section we provide examples of how to run Gambit using both --filename and --json. We provide more complete documentation in the configuration-files and cli-options sections below. ## Examples Unless otherwise noted, examples use code from benchmarks/ and are run from the root of the Gambit repository. Example 1: Mutating a single file To mutate a single file, use the --filename option (or -f), followed by the file to mutate. bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol This will generate: Generated 34 mutants in 0.69 seconds {note} The mutated file must be located within your current working directory or one of its subdirectories. If you want to mutate code in an arbitrary directory, use the --sourceroot option. Example 2: Mutating and downsampling The above command produced 34 mutants which may be more than you need. Gambit provides a way to randomly downsample the number of mutants with the --num_mutants or -n option: bash gambit mutate -f benchmarks/BinaryOpMutation/BinaryOpMutation.sol -n 3 which will generate: Generated 3 mutants in 0.15 seconds Example 3: Viewing Gambit results --- ## {note} This example assumes you've just completed Example 2. Gambit outputs all of its results in gambit_out: bash tree -L 2 gambit_out This produces: gambit_out ├── gambit_results.json ├── input_json │ ├── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast │ └── BinaryOpMutation.sol_json.ast.json ├── mutants │ ├── 1 │ ├── 2 │ └── 3 └── mutants.log See the results-directory section for a detailed explanation of this layout. The gambit summary command pretty prints each mutant for easy inspection: The output of gambit summary By default gambit summary prints info on all mutants. If you are interested in particular mutants you can specify a subset of mutant ids with the --mids flag. For instance, gambit summary --mids 3 4 5 will only print info for mutant ids 3 through 5. ## Example 4: Specifying solc pass-through arguments The Solidity compiler (solc) may need some extra information to successfully run on a file or a project. Gambit enables this with pass-through arguments that, as the name suggests, are passed directly through to the solc compiler. For projects that have complex dependencies and imports, you may need to: - Specify base paths: To specify the Solidity -base-path argument, use --solc_base_path: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_base_path base/path/dir - Specify remappings: To indicate where Solidity should find libraries, use solc's import remapping syntax with --solc_remappings: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_remappings @openzeppelin=node_modules/@openzeppelin @foo=node_modules/@foo {warning} The paths should ***NOT*** end with a trailing / Specify allow paths: To include additional allowed paths via solc's --allow-paths argument, use -- solc_allow_paths: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol \ --solc_allow_paths PATH1 --solc_allow_paths PATH2 ... Specify include-path: To make an additional source directory available to the default import callback via solc's [-- include-path][included] argument, use --solc_include_path: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_include_path PATH Use optimization: To run the Solidity compiler with optimizations (solc's --optimize argument), use -- solc_optimize: bash gambit mutate --filename path/to/file.sol --solc_optimize ## Example 5: The --sourceroot option Gambit needs to track the location of source files that it mutates within a project: for instance, imagine there are files foo/Foo.sol and bar/Foo.sol. These are separate files, and their path prefixes are needed to determine this. Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

gambit: ## Gambit: Mutant Generation for Solidity Gambit is a state-of-the-art mutation system for Solidity. By applying predefined syntax transformations called mutation operators (for example, convert a + b to a - b) to a Solidity program's source code, Gambit generates variants of the program called mutants. Mutants can be used to evaluate test suites or specs used for formal verification: each mutant represents a potential bug in the program, and stronger test suites and specifications should detect more mutants. ### Requirements - Gambit is written in Rust. You'll need to install Rust and Cargo to build Gambit. - Gambit uses solc, the Solidity compiler, to generate mutants. You'll need to have a solc binary that is compatible with the project you are mutating (see the --solc option in gambit mutate --help) ### Installation You can download prebuilt Gambit binaries for Linux x86-64 and Mac from our releases page. For Windows and Linux ARM, you must build Gambit from source. Building Gambit from source To build Gambit from source, clone the Gambit repository and run cargo install --path . from this repository's root. This will build Gambit and install it to a globally visible location on your PATH. You can also build gambit with cargo build --release from the root of this repository. This will create a gambit binary in gambit/target/release/ which you can manually place on your path or invoke directly (e.g., by calling path/to/gambit/target/release/gambit). ### Usage Gambit has two main commands: mutate and summary. gambit mutate is responsible for mutating code, and gambit summary is a convenience command for summarizing generated mutants in a human-readable way. Running gambit mutate will invoke solc, so make sure it is visible on your PATH. Alternatively, you can specify where Gambit can find the Solidity compiler with the option --solc path/to/solc, or specify a solc binary (e.g., solc8.12) with the option --solc solc8.12. Note: All tests (cargo test) are currently run using solc8.13. Your tests may fail if your solc points at a different version of the compiler. Running gambit mutate The gambit mutate command expects either a --filename argument or a --json argument. Using --filename allows you to specify a specific Solidity file to mutate: bash gambit mutate --filename file.sol However, if you want to mutate multiple files or apply a more complex set of parameters, we recommend using a configuration file via the --json option instead: bash gambit mutate --json gambit_conf.json --- Run gambit --help for more information. {note} All relative paths specified in a JSON configuration file are interpreted to be relative to the configuration file's parent directory. In the following section we provide examples of how to run Gambit using both --filename and --json. We provide more complete documentation in the {ref}configuration-files and {ref}cli-options sections below. Learn more at: https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/

mutation-verifier: We are actively working on mitigating them. - There are currently no official Gambit binaries for Linux ARM or Windows. That means that Gambit will not be installed with pip install certora-cli, and must be {ref}built from source <build-gambit-from-source>. - Sometimes, the problem stems from Gambit's mutant generation. Try running with --gambit_only and look at the generated mutations. --- ## Try running the Prover on your mutants individually using certoraRun Usually the mutant setup will be in .certora_internal/applied_mutants_dir and can be retried by running the Prover's .conf file with certoraRun. Manual mutants that don't show up in the report may have had a Solidity compilation error. It is also possible that you are encountering a bug with the underlying version of the Prover.

install: ## Installation These instructions are for Linux and macOS systems. Windows users should use WSL and follow the Linux installation instructions. ### Step 1: Prerequisites - Python3.8.16 or newer Check your Python3 version by executing the following command on the terminal: bash python3 --version If the version is < 3.8.16, follow the Python installation guide to upgrade. - Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or newer Check your Java version by executing the following command on the terminal: bash java -version If the version is < 11, download and install Java version 11 or later from Oracle. ### Solidity compiler (ideally v0.5 and up) - We recommend using solc-select to download and switch between Solidity compiler versions. - You can also download the Solidity compiler binaries from the official Solidity repository on GitHub. It is best to place all the solc binaries in the same path. - Certora employees can clone the CVT_Executables repository suitable for their OS from GitHub. ### Step 2: Install the Certora Prover package Tip: It is always recommended to use a Python virtual environment, such as venv or virtualenv, when installing a Python package. Execute the following command at the terminal to install the Prover: bash pip3 install certora-cli Caution: Note that the terminal may prompt you with a warning that some files, e.g. python3.x, are not included in the `PATH`, and should be added.
