# Managing Timeouts and Out of Memory Problems

In this chapter, we describe how to diagnose and remedy when the Certora Prover ran out of time or out of memory.

Out-of-memory problems are signified by an Extremely low available memory message in the Global Problems tab of the Prover reports, see {ref}memout-introduction for more details. Timeouts are signified either by a Global timeout reached message in the Global Problems tab, if the whole Prover job timed out, or by an orange clock symbol next to the rule, if that particular rule timed out, see {ref}timeouts-introduction for more details.
