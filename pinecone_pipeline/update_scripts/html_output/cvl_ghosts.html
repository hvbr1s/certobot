<h1>Ghosts</h1>
<p>Ghosts are a way of defining additional variables for use during verification.
These variables are often used to 
- communicate information between {ref}<code>rules-main</code> and {ref}<code>hooks</code>.
- define deterministic {ref}<code>function summaries &lt;function-summary&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Ghosts can be seen as an 'extension' to the state of the contracts under verification.
This means that in case a call reverts, the ghost values will revert to their pre-state.
Additionally, if an unresolved call is handled by a havoc, the ghost values will havoc as well.
Ghosts are regarded as part of the state of the contracts, 
and when calls are invoked with <code>at storageVar</code> statements (see {ref}<code>storage-type</code>),
they are restored to their state as saved in <code>storageVar</code>.
An exception to this rule are ghosts marked <em>persistent</em>.
Persistent ghosts are <strong>never</strong> havoced, and <strong>never</strong> reverted.
See {ref}<code>persistent-ghosts</code> below for more details and examples.</p>

<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The syntax for ghost declarations is given by the following <a href="ebnf-syntax">EBNF grammar</a>:</p>
<p>```
ghost ::= "ghost" type id                             (";" | "{" axioms "}")
        | "ghost" id "(" cvl_types ")" "returns" type (";" | "{" axioms "}")</p>
<p>persistent<em>ghost ::=  "persistent" "ghost" type id                             (";" | "{" axioms "}")
                    | "persistent" "ghost" id "(" cvl</em>types ")" "returns" type (";" | "{" axioms "}")</p>
<p>type ::= basic<em>type
       | "mapping" "(" cvl</em>type "=&gt;" type ")"</p>
<p>axiom ::= [ "init_state" ] "axiom" expression ";"
```</p>
<p>See {doc}<code>types</code> for the <code>type</code> and <code>cvl_type</code> productions, and {doc}<code>expr</code> for
the <code>expression</code> syntax.</p>
<p>(ghost-variables)=</p>
<h2>Declaring ghost variables</h2>
<p>Ghost variables must be declared at the top level of a specification file.
A ghost variable declaration includes the keyword <code>ghost</code> followed by the type and name
of the ghost variable.</p>
<p>The type of a ghost variable may be either a <a href="types.md">CVL type</a> or a <code>mapping</code> type.
Mapping types are similar to solidity mapping types.  They must have CVL types
as keys, but may contain either CVL types or mapping types as values.</p>
<p>For example, the following are valid ghost declarations:</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost uint x;
ghost mapping(address =&gt; mathint) balances;
ghost mapping(uint =&gt; mapping(uint =&gt; mathint)) delegations;
</code></p>
<p>while the following are invalid:</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost (uint, uint) x;                              // tuples are not CVL types
ghost mapping(mapping(uint =&gt; uint) =&gt; address) y; // mappings cannot be keys
</code></p>

<h2>Ghost Functions</h2>
<p>CVL also has support for "ghost functions".  These serve a different purpose from ghost variables, although they can be
used in similar ways.</p>
<p>Ghost functions must be declared at the top level of a specification file.
A ghost function declaration includes the keyword <code>ghost</code> followed by the name and signature of the ghost function.
Ghost functions should be used either:
- when there are no updates to the ghost as the deterministic behavior and axioms are the only properties of the ghost
- when updating the ghost - more than one entry is updated and then the havoc assuming statement is used.</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<h2>Restrictions on ghost definitions</h2>
<ul>
<li>A user-defined type, such as struct, array or interface is not allowed as the key or the output type of a <code>ghost mapping</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Using ghost variables</h2>
<p>While verifying a rule or invariant, the Prover considers every possible
initial value of a ghost variable (subject to its {ref}<code>ghost-axioms</code>,
see below).</p>
<p>Within CVL, you can read or write ghosts using the normal variable syntax.  For
example:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost mapping(address =&gt; mathint) balances;</p>
<p>function example(address user) {
    balances[user] = x;
}
```</p>
<p>The most common reason to use a ghost is to communicate information from a hook
back to the rule that triggered it.  For example, the following CVL checks
that a call to the contract method <code>do_update(user)</code> changes the contract
variable <code>userInfo[user]</code> and does not change <code>userInfo[other]</code> for any other
user:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost mapping(address =&gt; bool) updated;</p>
<p>hook Sstore userInfo[KEY address u] uint i {
    updated[u] = true;
}</p>
<p>rule update<em>changes</em>user(address user) {
    updated[user] = false;</p>
<pre><code>do_update(user);

assert updated[user] == true, "do_update(user) should affect user";
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>rule update<em>changes</em>no_other(address user, address other) {
    require user != other;
    require updated[other] == false;</p>
<pre><code>do_update(user);

assert updated[other] == false;
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>Here the <code>updated</code> ghost is used to communicate information from the <code>userInfo</code>
hook back to the <code>updated_changes_user</code> and <code>updated_changes_no_other</code> rules.</p>
<p>(ghost-axioms)=</p>
<h2>Ghost axioms</h2>
<p>Ghost axioms are properties that the Prover assumes whenever it makes use of a ghost.</p>
<p>(global-axioms)=</p>
<h3>Global axioms</h3>
<p>Sometimes we might want to constrain the behavior of a ghost in some particular way. 
In CVL this is achieved by writing axioms. Axioms are simply CVL expressions that the tool will then assume are true 
about the ghost. For example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost bar(uint256) returns uint256 {
    axiom forall uint256 x. bar(x) &gt; 10;
}
</code></p>
<p>In any rule that uses bar, no application of bar could ever evaluate to a number less than or equal to 10. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Certora/Examples/blob/14668d39a6ddc67af349bc5b82f73db73349ef18/CVLByExample/structs/BankAccounts/certora/specs/Bank.spec#L119"><code>axiom</code> example</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Initial state axioms</h3>
<p>When writing invariants, initial axioms are a way to express the “constructor state” of a ghost function. They are used 
only when checking the base step of invariants {ref}<code>invariant-as-rule</code>. Before checking the initial state of an invariant, the Certora Prover adds a <code>require</code> for each <code>init_state</code> axiom. <code>init_state</code> axioms are not used in rules or the preservation check for invariants.</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost mathint sumBalances{
    // assuming value zero at the initial state before constructor
    init_state axiom sumBalances == 0;
}
</code></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/Certora/Examples/blob/14668d39a6ddc67af349bc5b82f73db73349ef18/CVLByExample/ConstantProductPool/certora/spec/ConstantProductPool.spec#L207">initial state axiom example</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Restrictions on ghost axioms</h2>
<ul>
<li>A ghost axiom cannot refer to Solidity or CVL functions or to other ghosts. It can refer to the ghost itself.</li>
<li>Since the signature of a ghost contains just parameter types without names, it cannot refer to its parameters. 
<code>forall</code> can be used in order to refer the storage referred to by the parameters. <a href="https://github.com/Certora/Examples/blob/61ac29b1128c68aff7e8d1e77bc80bfcbd3528d6/CVLByExample/summary/ghost-summary/ghost-mapping/certora/specs/WithGhostSummary.spec#L12">Example</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>(persistent-ghosts)=</p>
<h2>Ghosts vs. persistent ghosts</h2>
<p>A <code>persistent ghost</code> is a <code>ghost</code> that will never be {ref}<code>havoc &lt;glossary&gt;</code>. The value of a non-persistent <code>ghost</code> will be <code>havoc'ed</code> when the Prover <code>havoc</code>s the storage, a <code>persistent ghost</code> however will keep its value when storage is havoced.</p>
<p>In most cases, non-persistent ghosts are the natural choice for a specification 
that requires extra tracking of information.</p>
<p>We present two examples where persistent ghosts are useful.</p>
<h3>Persistent ghosts that survive havocs</h3>
<p>In the first example, we want to track the occurrence of a potential reentrant call[^reentrancy]:</p>
<p>```cvl
persistent ghost bool reentrancy<em>happened {
    init</em>state axiom !reentrancy_happened;
}</p>
<p>hook CALL(uint g, address addr, uint value, uint argsOffset, uint argsLength, 
          uint retOffset, uint retLength) uint rc {
    if (addr == currentContract) {
        reentrancy<em>happened = reentrancy</em>happened 
                                || executingContract == currentContract;
    }
}</p>
<p>invariant no<em>reentrant</em>calls !reentrancy_happened;
```</p>
<p>To see why a persistent ghost must be used here for the variable <code>reentrancy_happened</code>, consider the following contract:
<code>solidity
contract NotReentrant {
    function transfer1Token(IERC20 a) external {
        require (address(a) != address(this));
        a.transfer(msg.sender, 1);
    }
}
</code></p>
<p>If we do not apply any linking or dispatching for the call done on the target <code>a</code>, the call to <code>transfer</code> would havoc.
During a havoc operation, the Prover conservatively assumes that almost any possible behavior can occur.
In particular, it must assume that during the execution of the <code>a.transfer</code> call, 
non-persistent ghosts can be updated arbitrarily (e.g. by other contracts),
and thus (assuming <code>reentrancy_happened</code> were not marked as persistent), 
the Prover considers the case where <code>reentrancy_happened</code> is set to <code>true</code> due to the havoc.
Thus, when the <code>CALL</code> hook executes immediately after, 
it does so where the <code>reentrancy_happened</code> value is already <code>true</code>, 
and thus the value after the hook will remain <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>In the lower-level view of the tool, the sequence of events is as follows:
1. A call to <code>a.transfer</code> which cannot be resolved and results in a {ref}<code>havoc &lt;glossary&gt;</code> operation.
Non-persistent ghosts are havoced, in particular <code>reentrancy_happened</code> if it were not marked as such.
2. A <code>CALL</code> hook executes, updating <code>reentrancy_happened</code> based on its havoced value, meaning it can turn to true.</p>
<p>Therefore even if the addresses of <code>a</code> and <code>NotReentrant</code> are distinct, we could still falsely detect a reentrant call as <code>reentrancy_happened</code> was set to true due to non-determinism.
The call trace would show <code>reentrancy_happened</code> as being determined to be true due to a havoc in the "Ghosts State" view under "Global State".</p>
<h3>Persistent ghosts that survive reverts</h3>
<p>In this example, we use persistent ghosts to determine if a revert happened with user-provided data or not.
This can help distinguishing between compiler-generated reverts and user-specified reverts (but only in <a href="https://soliditylang.org/blog/2020/10/28/solidity-0.8.x-preview/">Solidity versions prior to 0.8.x</a>).
The idea is to set a ghost to true if a <code>REVERT</code> opcode is encountered with a positive buffer size. As in early Solidity versions the panic errors would compile to reverts with empty buffers, as well as user-provided <code>require</code>s with no message specified. </p>
<p>```cvl
persistent ghost bool saw<em>user</em>defined<em>revert</em>msg;</p>
<p>hook REVERT(uint offset, uint size) {
    if (size &gt; 0) {
        saw<em>user</em>defined<em>revert</em>msg = true;
    }
}</p>
<p>rule mark<em>methods</em>that<em>have</em>user<em>defined</em>reverts(method f, env e, calldataarg args) {
    require !saw<em>user</em>defined<em>revert</em>msg;</p>
<pre><code>f@withrevert(e, args);

satisfy saw_user_defined_revert_msg;
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>To see why a regular ghost cannot be used to implement this rule, let's consider the following trivial contract:
```solidity
contract Reverting {
    function noUserDefinedRevertFlows(uint a, uint b) external {
        uint c = a/b; // will see a potential division-by-zero revert
        uint[] memory arr = new uint<a href="1"></a>;
        uint d = arr[a+b]; // will see a potential out-of-bounds access revert;
    }</p>
<pre><code>function userDefinedRequireMsg(uint a) external {
    require(a != 0, "a != 0");
}

function emptyRequire(uint a) external {
    require(a != 0);
}
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>It is expected for the method <code>userDefinedRequireMsg</code> to satisfy the rule, 
and it should be the only method to satisfy it.
Assuming <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> was defined as a regular, non-persistent ghost, 
the rule would not be satisfied for <code>userDefinedRequireMsg</code>: in case the input argument <code>a</code> is equal to 0,
the contract reverts, and the value of <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> 
is reset to its value before the call, which must be <code>false</code>
(because the rule required it before the call).
In this case, after the call <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> cannot be set to true and thus the <code>satisfy</code> fails.
Applying the same reasoning, it is clear that the same behavior happens 
for reverting behaviors of <code>noUserDefinedRevertFlows</code> and <code>emptyRequire</code>,
which do not have user-defined revert messages. 
This means that if <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> is not marked persistent, 
the rule cannot distinguishing between methods that may revert with user-defined messages and methods that may not.</p>

<p>If we do not apply any linking or dispatching for the call done on the target <code>a</code>, the call to <code>transfer</code> would havoc.
During a havoc operation, the Prover conservatively assumes that almost any possible behavior can occur.
In particular, it must assume that during the execution of the <code>a.transfer</code> call, 
non-persistent ghosts can be updated arbitrarily (e.g. by other contracts),
and thus (assuming <code>reentrancy_happened</code> were not marked as persistent), 
the Prover considers the case where <code>reentrancy_happened</code> is set to <code>true</code> due to the havoc.
Thus, when the <code>CALL</code> hook executes immediately after, 
it does so where the <code>reentrancy_happened</code> value is already <code>true</code>, 
and thus the value after the hook will remain <code>true</code>.</p>
<p>In the lower-level view of the tool, the sequence of events is as follows:
1. A call to <code>a.transfer</code> which cannot be resolved and results in a {ref}<code>havoc &lt;glossary&gt;</code> operation.
Non-persistent ghosts are havoced, in particular <code>reentrancy_happened</code> if it were not marked as such.
2. A <code>CALL</code> hook executes, updating <code>reentrancy_happened</code> based on its havoced value, meaning it can turn to true.</p>
<p>Therefore even if the addresses of <code>a</code> and <code>NotReentrant</code> are distinct, we could still falsely detect a reentrant call as <code>reentrancy_happened</code> was set to true due to non-determinism.
The call trace would show <code>reentrancy_happened</code> as being determined to be true due to a havoc in the "Ghosts State" view under "Global State".</p>
<h3>Persistent ghosts that survive reverts</h3>
<p>In this example, we use persistent ghosts to determine if a revert happened with user-provided data or not.
This can help distinguishing between compiler-generated reverts and user-specified reverts (but only in <a href="https://soliditylang.org/blog/2020/10/28/solidity-0.8.x-preview/">Solidity versions prior to 0.8.x</a>).
The idea is to set a ghost to true if a <code>REVERT</code> opcode is encountered with a positive buffer size. As in early Solidity versions the panic errors would compile to reverts with empty buffers, as well as user-provided <code>require</code>s with no message specified. </p>
<p>```cvl
persistent ghost bool saw<em>user</em>defined<em>revert</em>msg;</p>
<p>hook REVERT(uint offset, uint size) {
    if (size &gt; 0) {
        saw<em>user</em>defined<em>revert</em>msg = true;
    }
}</p>
<p>rule mark<em>methods</em>that<em>have</em>user<em>defined</em>reverts(method f, env e, calldataarg args) {
    require !saw<em>user</em>defined<em>revert</em>msg;</p>
<pre><code>f@withrevert(e, args);

satisfy saw_user_defined_revert_msg;
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>To see why a regular ghost cannot be used to implement this rule, let's consider the following trivial contract:
```solidity
contract Reverting {
    function noUserDefinedRevertFlows(uint a, uint b) external {
        uint c = a/b; // will see a potential division-by-zero revert
        uint[] memory arr = new uint<a href="1"></a>;
        uint d = arr[a+b]; // will see a potential out-of-bounds access revert;
    }</p>
<pre><code>function userDefinedRequireMsg(uint a) external {
    require(a != 0, "a != 0");
}

function emptyRequire(uint a) external {
    require(a != 0);
}
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>It is expected for the method <code>userDefinedRequireMsg</code> to satisfy the rule, 
and it should be the only method to satisfy it.
Assuming <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> was defined as a regular, non-persistent ghost, 
the rule would not be satisfied for <code>userDefinedRequireMsg</code>: in case the input argument <code>a</code> is equal to 0,
the contract reverts, and the value of <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> 
is reset to its value before the call, which must be <code>false</code>
(because the rule required it before the call).
In this case, after the call <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> cannot be set to true and thus the <code>satisfy</code> fails.
Applying the same reasoning, it is clear that the same behavior happens 
for reverting behaviors of <code>noUserDefinedRevertFlows</code> and <code>emptyRequire</code>,
which do not have user-defined revert messages. 
This means that if <code>saw_user_defined_revert_msg</code> is not marked persistent, 
the rule cannot distinguishing between methods that may revert with user-defined messages and methods that may not.</p>
