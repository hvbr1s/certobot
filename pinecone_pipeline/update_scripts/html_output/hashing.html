<h1>Modeling of Hashing in the Certora Prover</h1>
<p>In this document we present how the Keccak hash function is modeled in the
Certora Prover and how that impacts smart contract verification.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Keccak hash function is used heavily by Solidity smart contracts in an 
implicit way. 
Most prominently, all unbounded data structures in storage (arrays, mappings) 
receive their storage addresses as values of the Keccak function.
It is also possible to call the Keccak hash function explicitly, both through
a solidity built in function and through inline assembly.</p>
<p>The Certora Prover does not operate with an actual implementation of the Keccak
hash function, since this would make most verification intractable and provide 
no practical benefits.
Instead, the Certora Prover models the properties of the Keccak hash 
function that are crucial for the function of the smart contracts under 
verification while abstracting away from implementation details of the actual
hash function.</p>
<h2>Modeling the Keccak function (bounded case)</h2>
<p>The Certora Prover models the Keccak hash function as an arbitrary function that
is <em>injective with large gaps</em>.</p>
<p>The hash function <code>hash</code> being injective with large gaps means that on distinct
inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
  - the hashes <code>hash(x)</code> and <code>hash(y)</code> are also distinct, and
  - the gap between <code>hash(x)</code> and <code>hash(y)</code> is large enough that every additive 
    term <code>hash(x) + i</code> that occurs in the program is also distinct from <code>hash(y)</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the initial storage slots and large constants that appear in the code 
are reserved. I.e., we make sure that no hash value ends up colliding with slots 
0 to 10000 nor with any constant that is explicitly given in the source code. (The
latter constraint is necessary to avoid collisions with hashes that the solidity 
compiler has precompiled.)</p>
<p>These constraints are enough for the Solidity storage model to work as expected.
However, this modeling allows the Certora Prover to pick hash functions that
show different behavior from the actual Keccak function. For instance, it is
unlikely that the individual numeric values or their ordering matches that of
the Keccak function. We present some examples in the following subsection. We
have not observed a practical use case yet where the numeric values of the hash
function play a role, thus we chose this modeling for tractability reasons.</p>
<p>See the later subsection {ref}<code>Background: The Solidity Storage Model</code> for 
details on why this property is an adequate model for maintaining integrity
of solidity's storage operations.</p>
<h3>Examples (Imprecision of Modeling)</h3>
<p>We illustrate the implications of our modeling decisions using a few examples.</p>
<h3>Modeling does not account for individual values of the Keccak function</h3>
<p>The Keccak256-hash of the string <code>hello</code> is 
<code>0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8</code>.
However, due to our modeling, the Certora Prover cannot prove that fact. the
rule <code>hashOf17Eq</code> will show as "violated" since the Prover can pick a function 
for <code>keccak256</code> that assigns <code>hello</code> differently.
For the same reason the Prover also does not disprove that the hash of <code>17</code>
is <code>0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8</code>, since 
we allow it to choose <code>keccak256</code> appropriately.</p>
<p>```solidity
// CVL:
methods { hash(uint) returns (uint) envfree; }</p>
<p>rule hashOf17Eq {
    assert(hash("hello") == 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8);
}</p>
<p>rule hashOf17Neq {
    assert(hash("hello") != 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8);
}</p>
<p>// solidity:
contract C {
    function hash(string x) public returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(bytes(x));
    }
}
```</p>
<h3>Modeling does not account for ordering</h3>
<p>Whichever distinct values we chose for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the example below, on the
real Keccak function, one rule would be violated and one rule would not. In the 
modeling of the Certora Prover, both rules are violated, since the Prover is 
allowed to "invent" a hash function for each rule and will choose one that 
violates the property whenever there is such a function (as long as that 
function fulfills the "injectivity with large gaps" property).</p>
<p>```solidity
// CVL:
methods { hash(uint) returns (uint) envfree; }</p>
<p>definition x() : uint = 12345678
definition y() : uint = 87654321</p>
<p>rule hashXLowerOrEqualToHashY {
    assert hash(x()) &lt;= hash(y());
}</p>
<p>rule hashXLargerThanHashY {
    assert(hash(x()) &gt; hash(y()));
}</p>
<p>// solidity:
contract C {
    function hash(uint x) public returns (bytes32) {
        // we're assuming presence of some to<em>bytes function here; it's 
        // practical implementation is not relevant here
        return keccak256(to</em>bytes(x)); 
    }
}
```</p>
<h3>Constants in code vs hashes</h3>
<p>A special case in Certora Prover's modeling of hashing is the treatment of 
constants that appear in the code: The Prover implicitly assumes that the hash 
function never outputs one of these constants on any of the concrete inputs it 
gets in that program.</p>
<p>For an example, consider this rule and spec:</p>
<p>```
// CVL:
methods {
    function readAtSlotAddress() external returns (uint) envfree;
    function updateMap(uint k, uint v) external envfree;
}</p>
<p>rule foo {
    uint v1 = readAtSlotAddress();</p>
<pre><code>uint preImage;
uint x; 

updateMap(preImage, x);

uint v2 = readAtSlotAddress();

assert(v1 == v2);
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>// solidity
contract C {
    uint constant slotAddress = 1000000;</p>
<pre><code>mapping(uint =&gt; uint) map;

function updateMap(uint k, uint v) public {
    map[k] = v;
}

function readAtSlotAddress() public returns (uint r) {
    assembly {
        r := sload(slotAddress)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>The function <code>readAtSlotAddress</code> reads from storage at the slot with the number
1000000. The function <code>updateMap</code> updates a mapping; this means it updates
storage at a hash computed from its identifier (here 1, since it is the second
field in the contract) and the key <code>k</code>. Now, if <code>k</code> is chosen such that
<code>keccak(1, k)</code> equals 1000000, the map update would overwrite that storage
slot, and thus the assertion in the rule <code>foo</code> would be violated.</p>
<p>However, the Certora Prover will return "not violated" for this assertion, since
it assumes that no hash ever collides with the constant 1000000, which occurs in
the program.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we change the contract to leave <code>slotAddress</code>
uninitialized, then Certora Prover will return a violation, since then it can
choose the values such that <code>keccak(2, preImage)</code> == <code>slotAddress</code>.</p>
<p>Also see this <a href="https://prover.certora.com/output/91772/e02fc5c0f57c4404b6fe28f237ecab07?anonymousKey=9e9e40a985a82d55446b0cdc2c75a7540ca696bc">example run</a> 
for a further illustration of both cases.</p>
<p><code>{note}
The reader may wonder at first whether this means that the Certora Prover computes 
the inverse value of the Keccak function for some image value (which would be a 
challenging task in and of itself). This is not the case, in practice the Prover 
makes up any arbitrary function that fulfills the previously described axioms and 
also maps that single input to an output accordingly.
</code></p>
<h2>Hashing of unbounded data</h2>
<p>In the discussion so far we only considered hashes of data whose length is 
already known before program execution (e.g. a <code>uint</code> variable always has 256 
bits). Hashing of unbounded data (typically unbounded arrays, like <code>bytes</code>, 
<code>uint[]</code>, etc.) requires some extra measures, since their implementation 
requires loops and the Certora Prover 
{doc}<code>internally eliminates all loops &lt;loops&gt;</code> in order to achieve better 
tractability.</p>
<p>The Certora Prover models unbounded hashing similar to how it eliminates loops.
The user specifies an upper length bound up to which unbounded hashing should 
be modeled precisely (using the CLI option {ref}<code>--hashing_length_bound</code>) as 
well as whether this bound is to be assumed or to be verified (using the CLI
option {ref}<code>--optimistic_hashing</code>).</p>
<p>We demonstrate how these flags work using the following program snippet:</p>
<p><code>solidity
contract C {
    mapping(bytes =&gt; uint) m;
    bytes b1, b2, b3;
    uint u, v, w;
    // ...
        require b1.length &lt; 224;
        m[b1] = u;
    // ...
        // no constraints on b2.length
        m[b2] = v; 
    // ...
        // no constraints on b3.length
        m[b3] = v;
        assert(b3.length &lt; 300, "b3 is more than 300 bytes long, unexpectedly")
    // ...
}
</code></p>
<p>Let us assume that the <code>--hashing_length_bound</code> flag is set to 224 (which 
corresponds to 7 machine words).</p>
<p>Then, the first hash operation, triggered by the mapping access <code>m[b1]</code>, behaves
like the hash of a bounded data chunk. The <code>--optimstic_hashing</code> flag has no 
impact on this hash operation.</p>
<p>The behavior of the second hash operation, triggered by the mapping access <code>m[b2]</code>,
depends on whether <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> is set. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> flag is not set, the violation of an internal 
assertion will be reported by the Prover, stating that a chunk of data is being
hashed that may exceed the given bound of 224.
The reported message will look like this:
<code>text
Trying to hash a non-constant length array whose length may exceed the bound 
(set in option "--hashing_length_bound", current value is 224). 
Optimistic unbounded hashing is currently deactivated (can be activated via 
option "--optimistic_hashing").
</code></p></li>
<li><p>If the <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> flag is set, the Prover will internally make an
assumption (equivalent to a <code>require</code> statement) on <code>b2</code> stating that its length cannot
exceed 224 bytes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third operation, triggered by the mapping access <code>m[b3]</code> behaves like the second, 
since no length constraint on <code>b3</code> is made by the program. 
However, we can see the impact of the <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> flag on the <code>assert</code> 
command that follows the hash operation: 
When the flag is set, the assertion will be shown as not violated
even though nothing in the program itself prevents <code>b3</code> from being longer than 
300 bytes. This is an example of unsoundness coming from "optimistic" assumptions.
(When <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> is not set, then we get a violation from any or all
assertions, depending on the configuration of the Certora Prover.)</p>
<h3>Examples for Unbounded Hashing</h3>
<p>The following collection snippet illustrates the most common use cases for
hashing of data that has unbounded length.</p>
<p>```solidity
contract C {
    mapping(bytes =&gt; uint) m;
    uint x, y, z, start, len;
    // ... 
        m[b] = v
    // ... 
        keccak256(abi.encode(x, y, z))
    // ... 
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(x, y, z))
    // ...
        assembly {
            keccak(start, len)
        }
    // ...
}</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Probably the most common use case is the use of mappings whose keys are an 
unbounded array (<code>bytes</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>uint[]</code>, etc.); any access to such a 
mapping induces a hash of the corresponding array whose length is often unknown
and unbounded.</p>
<p>Further use cases include direct calls of the Keccak function, either directly
on Solidity or inside an inline assembly snippet.</p>
<p>Note that the Certora Prover's static analysis is aware of the ABI encoder. Thus,
in many cases, it can figure out that when <code>x, y, z</code> are scalars that 
<code>keccak256(abi.encode(x, y, z))</code> is actually a bounded hash of the form 
<code>hash(x, y, z)</code> as opposed to an unbounded hash of the <code>bytes</code> array that is the
result of the <code>encode</code> function.</p>
<p>(Background: The Solidity Storage Model)=</p>
<h2>Background: The Solidity Storage Model</h2>
<p>In this subsection we illustrate the consequences on storage integrity if the
"injectivity with large gaps" property is not maintained.</p>
<p>For instance consider this contract:
```solidity
// solidity
contract C {
    uint i;                  // slot 0
    uint[] a;                // slot 1
    mapping(uint =&gt; uint) m; // slot 2</p>
<pre><code>/** Always returns writeToArray (unless hashing is broken). */
function foo(uint writeToArray, uint writeToMap) public returns (uint) {
    i = u;               // sstore(0, u)
    a[j] = writeToArray; // sstore(hash(1) + j, writeToArray)
    m[k] = writeToMap;   // sstore(hash(2, k), writeToMap)
    return a[j];
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>// CVL
methods { foo(uint, uint) return (uint); };</p>
<p>rule storageIntegrity {
    uint writeToArray, writeToMap;
    require writeToArray != writeToMap;</p>
<pre><code>uint res = foo(writeToArray, writeToMap)

assert(res == writeToArray);
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>The comments of the function <code>foo</code> illustrate how storage is laid out by 
Solidity.
The occurrences of <code>sstore(x, y)</code> in the line comments above denote a storage
update of storage address <code>x</code> to value <code>y</code>.
The scalar <code>i</code> is stored at storage address <code>0</code>, which is derived from its 
slot number in the contract (slots are numbered in order of appearance in the
source code).
The array <code>a</code> is stored contiguously, starting from slot <code>hash(1)</code>.
The entries of mapping <code>m</code> are spread out over storage; their locations are 
computed as the hash of the mapping's storage slot and the key at which the
mapping is being accessed; thus the storage slot used for the entry of <code>m</code> under
 key <code>k</code> is computed as <code>hash(2, k)</code>.</p>
<p>We can see that non-collision of hashes is essential for storage integrity. 
E.g., if <code>hash(1) + j</code> was equal to <code>hash(2, k)</code> then the operations on <code>a</code> and
<code>m</code> would interfere with each other, and <code>foo</code> would return the value of 
<code>writeToMap</code> rather than the value of <code>writeToArray</code>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize, the Certora Prover handles hashing in a way that behaves as
expected for most hashes. </p>
<p>However, it is good to be aware of limitations of the modeling; i.e. that not
all properties of the actual Keccak function are preserved but only the ones 
that are crucial for practical use cases, which are covered by the "injectivity
with large gaps" property.</p>
<p>Furthermore, special attention may be necessary when hashing of unbounded data
is required. For this case, Certora Prover relies on user-controlled 
approximations that are analogous to its handling of loops.</p>

<h1>Modeling of Hashing in the Certora Prover</h1>
<p>In this document we present how the Keccak hash function is modeled in the
Certora Prover and how that impacts smart contract verification.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The Keccak hash function is used heavily by Solidity smart contracts in an 
implicit way. 
Most prominently, all unbounded data structures in storage (arrays, mappings) 
receive their storage addresses as values of the Keccak function.
It is also possible to call the Keccak hash function explicitly, both through
a solidity built in function and through inline assembly.</p>
<p>The Certora Prover does not operate with an actual implementation of the Keccak
hash function, since this would make most verification intractable and provide 
no practical benefits.
Instead, the Certora Prover models the properties of the Keccak hash 
function that are crucial for the function of the smart contracts under 
verification while abstracting away from implementation details of the actual
hash function.</p>
<h2>Modeling the Keccak function (bounded case)</h2>
<p>The Certora Prover models the Keccak hash function as an arbitrary function that
is <em>injective with large gaps</em>.</p>
<p>The hash function <code>hash</code> being injective with large gaps means that on distinct
inputs <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
  - the hashes <code>hash(x)</code> and <code>hash(y)</code> are also distinct, and
  - the gap between <code>hash(x)</code> and <code>hash(y)</code> is large enough that every additive 
    term <code>hash(x) + i</code> that occurs in the program is also distinct from <code>hash(y)</code>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the initial storage slots and large constants that appear in the code 
are reserved. I.e., we make sure that no hash value ends up colliding with slots 
0 to 10000 nor with any constant that is explicitly given in the source code. (The
latter constraint is necessary to avoid collisions with hashes that the solidity 
compiler has precompiled.)</p>
<p>These constraints are enough for the Solidity storage model to work as expected.
However, this modeling allows the Certora Prover to pick hash functions that
show different behavior from the actual Keccak function. For instance, it is
unlikely that the individual numeric values or their ordering matches that of
the Keccak function. We present some examples in the following subsection. We
have not observed a practical use case yet where the numeric values of the hash
function play a role, thus we chose this modeling for tractability reasons.</p>
<p>See the later subsection {ref}<code>Background: The Solidity Storage Model</code> for 
details on why this property is an adequate model for maintaining integrity
of solidity's storage operations.</p>
<h3>Examples (Imprecision of Modeling)</h3>
<p>We illustrate the implications of our modeling decisions using a few examples.</p>
<h3>Modeling does not account for individual values of the Keccak function</h3>
<p>The Keccak256-hash of the string <code>hello</code> is 
<code>0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8</code>.
However, due to our modeling, the Certora Prover cannot prove that fact. the
rule <code>hashOf17Eq</code> will show as "violated" since the Prover can pick a function 
for <code>keccak256</code> that assigns <code>hello</code> differently.
For the same reason the Prover also does not disprove that the hash of <code>17</code>
is <code>0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8</code>, since 
we allow it to choose <code>keccak256</code> appropriately.</p>
<p>```solidity
// CVL:
methods { hash(uint) returns (uint) envfree; }</p>
<p>rule hashOf17Eq {
    assert(hash("hello") == 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8);
}</p>
<p>rule hashOf17Neq {
    assert(hash("hello") != 0x1c8aff950685c2ed4bc3174f3472287b56d9517b9c948127319a09a7a36deac8);
}</p>
<p>// solidity:
contract C {
    function hash(string x) public returns (bytes32) {
        return keccak256(bytes(x));
    }
}
```</p>
<h3>Modeling does not account for ordering</h3>
<p>Whichever distinct values we chose for <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> in the example below, on the
real Keccak function, one rule would be violated and one rule would not. In the 
modeling of the Certora Prover, both rules are violated, since the Prover is 
allowed to "invent" a hash function for each rule and will choose one that 
violates the property whenever there is such a function (as long as that 
function fulfills the "injectivity with large gaps" property).</p>
<p>```solidity
// CVL:
methods { hash(uint) returns (uint) envfree; }</p>
<p>definition x() : uint = 12345678
definition y() : uint = 87654321</p>
<p>rule hashXLowerOrEqualToHashY {
    assert hash(x()) &lt;= hash(y());
}</p>
<p>rule hashXLargerThanHashY {
    assert(hash(x()) &gt; hash(y()));
}</p>
<p>// solidity:
contract C {
    function hash(uint x) public returns (bytes32) {
        // we're assuming presence of some to<em>bytes function here; it's 
        // practical implementation is not relevant here
        return keccak256(to</em>bytes(x)); 
    }
}
```</p>
<h3>Constants in code vs hashes</h3>
<p>A special case in Certora Prover's modeling of hashing is the treatment of 
constants that appear in the code: The Prover implicitly assumes that the hash 
function never outputs one of these constants on any of the concrete inputs it 
gets in that program.</p>
<p>For an example, consider this rule and spec:</p>
<p>```
// CVL:
methods {
    function readAtSlotAddress() external returns (uint) envfree;
    function updateMap(uint k, uint v) external envfree;
}</p>
<p>rule foo {
    uint v1 = readAtSlotAddress();</p>
<pre><code>uint preImage;
uint x; 

updateMap(preImage, x);

uint v2 = readAtSlotAddress();

assert(v1 == v2);
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>// solidity
contract C {
    uint constant slotAddress = 1000000;</p>
<pre><code>mapping(uint =&gt; uint) map;

function updateMap(uint k, uint v) public {
    map[k] = v;
}

function readAtSlotAddress() public returns (uint r) {
    assembly {
        r := sload(slotAddress)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>The function <code>readAtSlotAddress</code> reads from storage at the slot with the number
1000000. The function <code>updateMap</code> updates a mapping; this means it updates
storage at a hash computed from its identifier (here 1, since it is the second
field in the contract) and the key <code>k</code>. Now, if <code>k</code> is chosen such that
<code>keccak(1, k)</code> equals 1000000, the map update would overwrite that storage
slot, and thus the assertion in the rule <code>foo</code> would be violated.</p>
<p>However, the Certora Prover will return "not violated" for this assertion, since
it assumes that no hash ever collides with the constant 1000000, which occurs in
the program.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if we change the contract to leave <code>slotAddress</code>
uninitialized, then Certora Prover will return a violation, since then it can
choose the values such that <code>keccak(2, preImage)</code> == <code>slotAddress</code>.</p>
<p>Also see this <a href="https://prover.certora.com/output/91772/e02fc5c0f57c4404b6fe28f237ecab07?anonymousKey=9e9e40a985a82d55446b0cdc2c75a7540ca696bc">example run</a> 
for a further illustration of both cases.</p>
<p><code>{note}
The reader may wonder at first whether this means that the Certora Prover computes 
the inverse value of the Keccak function for some image value (which would be a 
challenging task in and of itself). This is not the case, in practice the Prover 
makes up any arbitrary function that fulfills the previously described axioms and 
also maps that single input to an output accordingly.
</code></p>
<h2>Hashing of unbounded data</h2>
<p>In the discussion so far we only considered hashes of data whose length is 
already known before program execution (e.g. a <code>uint</code> variable always has 256 
bits). Hashing of unbounded data (typically unbounded arrays, like <code>bytes</code>, 
<code>uint[]</code>, etc.) requires some extra measures, since their implementation 
requires loops and the Certora Prover 
{doc}<code>internally eliminates all loops &lt;loops&gt;</code> in order to achieve better 
tractability.</p>
<p>The Certora Prover models unbounded hashing similar to how it eliminates loops.
The user specifies an upper length bound up to which unbounded hashing should 
be modeled precisely (using the CLI option {ref}<code>--hashing_length_bound</code>) as 
well as whether this bound is to be assumed or to be verified (using the CLI
option {ref}<code>--optimistic_hashing</code>).</p>
<p>We demonstrate how these flags work using the following program snippet:</p>
<p><code>solidity
contract C {
    mapping(bytes =&gt; uint) m;
    bytes b1, b2, b3;
    uint u, v, w;
    // ...
        require b1.length &lt; 224;
        m[b1] = u;
    // ...
        // no constraints on b2.length
        m[b2] = v; 
    // ...
        // no constraints on b3.length
        m[b3] = v;
        assert(b3.length &lt; 300, "b3 is more than 300 bytes long, unexpectedly")
    // ...
}
</code></p>
<p>Let us assume that the <code>--hashing_length_bound</code> flag is set to 224 (which 
corresponds to 7 machine words).</p>
<p>Then, the first hash operation, triggered by the mapping access <code>m[b1]</code>, behaves
like the hash of a bounded data chunk. The <code>--optimstic_hashing</code> flag has no 
impact on this hash operation.</p>
<p>The behavior of the second hash operation, triggered by the mapping access <code>m[b2]</code>,
depends on whether <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> is set. </p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> flag is not set, the violation of an internal 
assertion will be reported by the Prover, stating that a chunk of data is being
hashed that may exceed the given bound of 224.
The reported message will look like this:
<code>text
Trying to hash a non-constant length array whose length may exceed the bound 
(set in option "--hashing_length_bound", current value is 224). 
Optimistic unbounded hashing is currently deactivated (can be activated via 
option "--optimistic_hashing").
</code></p></li>
<li><p>If the <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> flag is set, the Prover will internally make an
assumption (equivalent to a <code>require</code> statement) on <code>b2</code> stating that its length cannot
exceed 224 bytes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The third operation, triggered by the mapping access <code>m[b3]</code> behaves like the second, 
since no length constraint on <code>b3</code> is made by the program. 
However, we can see the impact of the <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> flag on the <code>assert</code> 
command that follows the hash operation: 
When the flag is set, the assertion will be shown as not violated
even though nothing in the program itself prevents <code>b3</code> from being longer than 
300 bytes. This is an example of unsoundness coming from "optimistic" assumptions.
(When <code>--optimistic_hashing</code> is not set, then we get a violation from any or all
assertions, depending on the configuration of the Certora Prover.)</p>
<h3>Examples for Unbounded Hashing</h3>
<p>The following collection snippet illustrates the most common use cases for
hashing of data that has unbounded length.</p>
<p>```solidity
contract C {
    mapping(bytes =&gt; uint) m;
    uint x, y, z, start, len;
    // ... 
        m[b] = v
    // ... 
        keccak256(abi.encode(x, y, z))
    // ... 
        keccak256(abi.encodePacked(x, y, z))
    // ...
        assembly {
            keccak(start, len)
        }
    // ...
}</p>
<p>```</p>
<p>Probably the most common use case is the use of mappings whose keys are an 
unbounded array (<code>bytes</code>, <code>string</code>, <code>uint[]</code>, etc.); any access to such a 
mapping induces a hash of the corresponding array whose length is often unknown
and unbounded.</p>
<p>Further use cases include direct calls of the Keccak function, either directly
on Solidity or inside an inline assembly snippet.</p>
<p>Note that the Certora Prover's static analysis is aware of the ABI encoder. Thus,
in many cases, it can figure out that when <code>x, y, z</code> are scalars that 
<code>keccak256(abi.encode(x, y, z))</code> is actually a bounded hash of the form 
<code>hash(x, y, z)</code> as opposed to an unbounded hash of the <code>bytes</code> array that is the
result of the <code>encode</code> function.</p>

<h2>Background: The Solidity Storage Model</h2>
<p>In this subsection we illustrate the consequences on storage integrity if the
"injectivity with large gaps" property is not maintained.</p>
<p>For instance consider this contract:
```solidity
// solidity
contract C {
    uint i;                  // slot 0
    uint[] a;                // slot 1
    mapping(uint =&gt; uint) m; // slot 2</p>
<pre><code>/** Always returns writeToArray (unless hashing is broken). */
function foo(uint writeToArray, uint writeToMap) public returns (uint) {
    i = u;               // sstore(0, u)
    a[j] = writeToArray; // sstore(hash(1) + j, writeToArray)
    m[k] = writeToMap;   // sstore(hash(2, k), writeToMap)
    return a[j];
}
</code></pre>
<p>}</p>
<p>// CVL
methods { foo(uint, uint) return (uint); };</p>
<p>rule storageIntegrity {
    uint writeToArray, writeToMap;
    require writeToArray != writeToMap;</p>
<pre><code>uint res = foo(writeToArray, writeToMap)

assert(res == writeToArray);
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>The comments of the function <code>foo</code> illustrate how storage is laid out by 
Solidity.
The occurrences of <code>sstore(x, y)</code> in the line comments above denote a storage
update of storage address <code>x</code> to value <code>y</code>.
The scalar <code>i</code> is stored at storage address <code>0</code>, which is derived from its 
slot number in the contract (slots are numbered in order of appearance in the
source code).
The array <code>a</code> is stored contiguously, starting from slot <code>hash(1)</code>.
The entries of mapping <code>m</code> are spread out over storage; their locations are 
computed as the hash of the mapping's storage slot and the key at which the
mapping is being accessed; thus the storage slot used for the entry of <code>m</code> under
 key <code>k</code> is computed as <code>hash(2, k)</code>.</p>
<p>We can see that non-collision of hashes is essential for storage integrity. 
E.g., if <code>hash(1) + j</code> was equal to <code>hash(2, k)</code> then the operations on <code>a</code> and
<code>m</code> would interfere with each other, and <code>foo</code> would return the value of 
<code>writeToMap</code> rather than the value of <code>writeToArray</code>.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize, the Certora Prover handles hashing in a way that behaves as
expected for most hashes. </p>
<p>However, it is good to be aware of limitations of the modeling; i.e. that not
all properties of the actual Keccak function are preserved but only the ones 
that are crucial for practical use cases, which are covered by the "injectivity
with large gaps" property.</p>
<p>Furthermore, special attention may be necessary when hashing of unbounded data
is required. For this case, Certora Prover relies on user-controlled 
approximations that are analogous to its handling of loops.</p>
