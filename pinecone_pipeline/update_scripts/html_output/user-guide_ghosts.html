<h1>Tracking changes with ghosts and hooks</h1>
<p>Sometimes it is useful for a rule to observe changes to a particular part of
storage, or otherwise track the behavior of a contract while it is executing.
For example, while verifying an ERC20 contract, we may want to observe each
update to any user balance so that we can keep our own running tally of the
total supply.</p>
<p>{ref}<code>Ghosts &lt;ghost-variables&gt;</code> and {ref}<code>hooks &lt;hooks&gt;</code> are designed for this
purpose.  Ghosts are additional variables that you can add to use during
verification.  They are similar to contract storage variables — they are
rolled back when a contract function reverts or when the storage is reset.</p>
<p>Hooks are blocks of CVL code that get executed when a contract performs a
certain instruction.  For example, a store hook will be run whenever the
contract updates a storage variable, while a call hook will be run whenever the
contract makes an external call.</p>
<p>Together, hooks and ghosts let you keep track of what the contract does during
execution.</p>
