<h1>Changes Introduced in CVL 2</h1>
<p>CVL 2 is a major overhaul to the type system of CVL. Though many
of the changes are internal, we wanted to take this opportunity to
introduce a few improvements to the syntax.  The general goal of these changes
is to make the behavior of CVL more explicit and predictable, and to bring the
syntax more in line with Solidity's syntax.</p>
<p>This document summarizes the changes to CVL syntax introduced by CVL 2.</p>
<p>The <code>CVLMigration</code> repository contains examples demonstrating each of the
changes; the <code>cvl1</code> branch contains the examples in valid CVL 1 syntax, while
the <code>cvl2</code> branch contains the same examples in CVL 2 syntax.  You can see the
differences <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split">here</a>, our you can clone <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration">the
repository</a> and compare the <code>cvl1</code> and <code>cvl2</code> branches using
your favorite tools.</p>

<h2>Superficial syntax changes</h2>
<p>There are several simple changes to the syntax to make specs more uniform and
consistent, and to reduce the superficial differences with Solidity.</p>
<h3><code>function</code> and <code>;</code> required for methods block entries</h3>
<p>In CVL 2, methods block entries must now start with <code>function</code> and end with
<code>;</code> (semicolons were optional in CVL 1).  For example
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-9cd1ae6f2c8146e323568cb25c79d4f6671fcb690872dce33591bd514759fc24">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
transferFrom(address, address, uint) returns(bool) envfree
</code>
will become
<code>cvl
function transferFrom(address, address, uint) external returns(bool) envfree;
</code>
(note also the addition of <code>external</code>, {ref}<code>described below &lt;cvl2-visibility&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>This is also true for entries with summaries:
<code>cvl
balanceOf(address) returns(uint256) =&gt; ALWAYS(3)
</code>
will become
<code>cvl
function balanceOf(address) external returns(uint256) =&gt; ALWAYS(3);
</code></p>
<p>If you do not change this, you will get an error message like the following:
<code>
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec:4:5: Syntax error: unexpected token near ID(transferFrom)
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec:4:5: Couldn't repair and continue parse unexpected token near ID(transferFrom)
</code></p>
<h3>Required <code>;</code> in more places</h3>
<p><code>using</code>, <code>import</code>, <code>use</code>, and <code>invariant</code> statements all require a <code>;</code> at the
end.  For example
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/Semicolons.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/Semicolons.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-15fb1ef5e6524f8a661d83ae5160b6b072840c5c54bf8d07733aab32b9da73f7">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
invariant balanceOfZeroIsZero()
    balanceOf(0) == 0
</code></p>
<p>becomes
<code>cvl
invariant balanceOfZeroIsZero()
    balanceOf(0) == 0;
</code></p>
<p><code>use</code> and <code>invariant</code> statements do not require (and may not have) a semicolon
if they are followed by a <code>preserved</code> or <code>filtered</code> block.  For example, the
following is valid in both CVL 1 and CVL 2:</p>
<p><code>cvl
invariant totalSupplyBoundsBalance(address a)
    balanceOf(a) &lt;= totalSupply()
    { preserved { require false; } }
</code></p>
<p>If you do not change this, you will see an error like the following:
<code>
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/Semicolons.spec:5:1: Syntax error: unexpected token near using
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/Semicolons.spec:5:1: Couldn't repair and continue parse unexpected token near using
</code></p>
<h3>Method literals require <code>sig:</code></h3>
<p>In some places in CVL, you can refer to a contract method by its name and
argument types.  For example, you might write
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/MethodLiterals.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/MethodLiterals.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-41df8240fa5faa12531baa82863891b94abf3fb3b859bdd10bafde73b60eda5d">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
f.selector == approve(address, uint).selector
</code></p>
<p>In this example, <code>approve(address,uint)</code> is a <em>method literal</em>.  In CVL 2,
these methods literals must now start with <code>sig:</code>.  For example, the above
would become:</p>
<p><code>cvl
f.selector == sig:approve(address, uint).selector
</code></p>
<p>If you do not change this, you will see the following error:
<code>
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:14:5): Variable address is undefined (first instance only reported)
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:14:5): Variable uint is undefined (first instance only reported)
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:15:34): could not type expression "address", message: unknown variable "address"
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:15:43): could not type expression "uint", message: unknown variable "uint"
</code></p>
<h3>Use of contract name instead of <code>using</code> variable</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, the only way to refer to a contract in the {term}<code>scene</code> was to first
introduce a contract instance variable with a <code>using</code> statement, and then use
that variable.  For example, to access a struct type <code>S</code> defined in
<code>PrimaryContract.sol</code>, you would need to write
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/ContractNames.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/ContractNames.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-a6a2974b81074e87d755753c2e84ef1b0cb553bfdeb729827959e0c63f0d02d7">diff</a>):</p>
<p>```cvl
using PrimaryContract as primary;</p>
<p>rule structExample {
    primary.S x;
    ...
}
```</p>
<p>In CVL 2, you must now use the name of the contract, rather than the instance
variable, when referring to user-defined types.  The above example would now be
written</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule structExample {
    PrimaryContract.S x;
    ...
}
</code></p>
<p>There is no need for a <code>using</code> statement in this example.</p>
<p>If you don't change this, you will an error like the following:
<code>
Error: Error in spec file (ContractNames.spec:12:19): Contract name primary does not exist in the scene. Make sure you are using a contract name and not a contract instance name.
</code></p>
<p>Calling methods on secondary contracts still requires using a contract instance
variable:</p>
<p>```cvl
using SecondaryContract as secondary;</p>
<p>rule multicontractExample {
    ...
    secondary.balanceOf(0);
    ...
}
```</p>
<p>Entries in the <code>methods</code> block may use either the contract name or an instance
variable:</p>
<p>```cvl
using SecondaryContract as secondary;</p>
<p>methods {
    //// both are valid (and the effect is the same):
    secondary.balanceOf(address) returns(uint) envfree
    SecondaryContract.transfer(address, uint) returns(bool) envfree
}
```</p>
<p>Using the contract name in the methods block currently has the same effect as
using an instance variable; this may change in future versions of CVL.</p>
<h3>Rules must start with <code>rule</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could omit the keyword <code>rule</code> when writing rules
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/RuleKeyword.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/RuleKeyword.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-b39a57bffd39f86bc1f9555a487af389f501eab9e66a1c3059a89691319da248">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
transferReverts {
    ...
}
</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2, the <code>rule</code> keyword is no longer optional:</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule transferReverts {
    ...
}
</code></p>
<p>If you don't change this, you will receive an error like the following:
<code>
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/RuleKeyword.spec:3:1: Syntax error: unexpected token near ID(transferReverts)
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-methods-blocks)=</p>
<h2>Changes to methods block entries</h2>
<p>In addition to the superficial changes listed above, there are some changes to
the way that methods block entries can be written (there are also a
{ref}<code>few instances &lt;cvl2-wildcards&gt;</code> where the meanings of entries has
changed).  In CVL 1, <code>methods</code> block entries often had several different
functions and meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were used to indicate targets for summarization</li>
<li>They were used to write generic specs that could apply to contracts with
missing methods</li>
<li>They were used to declare targets <code>envfree</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes described in this section make these different uses more explicit:</p>
<p><code>{contents}
:local:
:depth: 1
</code></p>
<h3>Most Solidity types allowed as arguments</h3>
<p>CVL 1 had some restrictions on the types of arguments allowed in <code>methods</code> block
entries.  For example, user-defined types (such as enums and structs) were not
fully supported.</p>
<p>CVL 2 <code>methods</code> block entries may use any Solidity types for arguments and
return values, except for <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/types.html#function-types">function types</a> and contract or
interface types.</p>
<p>To work around the missing types, CVL 1 allowed users to encode some
user-defined types as primitive types in the <code>methods</code> block; these workarounds
are no longer allowed in CVL 2.  For example, consider the following <a href="https://TODO/">solidity
function</a>:</p>
<p>```solidity
contract Example {
    enum Permission { READ, WRITE };</p>
<pre><code>function f(Permission p) internal { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>In CVL 1, a methods block entry for <code>f</code> would need to declare that it takes a
<code>uint8</code> argument:</p>
<p><code>cvl
methods {
    f(uint8 permission) =&gt; NONDET
}
</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2, the methods block entry should use the same type as the Solidity
implementations[^contract-types] (<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-5b1b684b999817bab176753b548b9ca548c8e9a1b7ce72d355030a8e03f498d8">compare files</a>),
except for function types and contract or interface types:</p>
<p><code>cvl
methods {
    function f(Example.Permission p) internal =&gt; NONDET;
}
</code>
The method can be called from CVL as follows:
<code>cvl
rule example {
    f(Example.Permission.READ);
}
</code></p>
<p>Contract functions that take or return contract or interface types should
instead use <code>address</code> in the <code>methods</code> block declaration.  For example, if the
contract contains the following function:</p>
<p><code>solidity
function listToken(IERC20 token) internal { ... }
</code></p>
<p>the <code>methods</code> block should use <code>address</code> for the <code>token</code> argument:</p>
<p><code>cvl
methods {
    function listToken(address token) internal;
}
</code></p>
<p>Contract functions that take or return function types are not currently
supported.</p>
<p>(cvl2-visibility)=</p>
<h3>Required <code>internal</code> or <code>external</code> annotation</h3>
<p>Every methods block entry must be marked either <code>internal</code> or <code>external</code>.  The
annotation must come after the argument list and before the <code>returns</code> clause.</p>
<p>If a function is declared <code>public</code> in Solidity, then the Solidity compiler
creates an internal implementation method, and an external wrapper method that
calls the internal implementation.  Therefore, you can summarize a <code>public</code>
method by marking the summarization <code>internal</code>.</p>
<p><code>{warning}
The behavior of `internal` vs. `external` summarization for public methods can
be confusing, especially because functions called directly from CVL are not
summarized.  See {ref}`methods-visibility`.
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-optional)=</p>
<h3><code>optional</code> methods block entries</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could write an entry in the methods block for a method that does
not exist in the contract; rules that would call the non-existent method were
skipped during verification.</p>
<p>This behavior can lead to confusion, because typos or name changes could silently
cause a rule to be skipped.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, this behavior is still available, but the methods entry must contain
the keyword <code>optional</code> somewhere after the <code>returns</code> clause and before the
summarization (if any).</p>
<p>(cvl2-locations)=</p>
<h3>Required <code>calldata</code>, <code>memory</code>, or <code>storage</code> annotations for reference types</h3>
<p>In CVL 2, methods block entries for internal functions must contain either <code>calldata</code>,
<code>memory</code>, or <code>storage</code> annotations for all arguments with reference types (such
as arrays).</p>
<p>For methods block entries of external functions the location annotation must be
omitted unless it's the <code>storage</code> annotation on an external library function, in
which case it is required (the reasoning here is to have the information required
in order to correctly calculate a function's sighash).</p>
<p>(cvl2-wildcards)=</p>
<h3>Summaries only apply to one contract by default</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, a summary in the <code>methods</code> block applied to all methods with the
given signature.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, summaries only apply to a single contract, unless the old behavior is
explicitly requested by using <code>_</code> as the receiver.  If no contract is specified,
the default is <code>currentContract</code>.</p>
<p><code>{note}
The receiver contract must be the contract where the method is defined.  If a
contract inherits a method defined in a supercontract, the receiver must be the
supercontract, rather than the inheriting contract.
</code></p>
<p>Entries that use <code>_</code> as the receiver are called {term}<code>wildcard entries &lt;wildcard&gt;</code>, summaries
that do not are called {term}<code>exact entries &lt;exact&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:
```cvl
using C as c;</p>
<p>methods {
    function f(uint)   internal =&gt; NONDET;
    function c.g(uint) internal =&gt; ALWAYS(4);
    function h(uint)   internal =&gt; ALWAYS(1);
    function _.h(uint) internal =&gt; NONDET;
}
```</p>
<p>In this example, the internal function <code>currentContract.f</code> has a <code>NONDET</code>
summary, <code>c.g</code> has an <code>ALWAYS</code> summary, a call to <code>currentContact.h</code> has an
<code>ALWAYS</code> summary and a call to <code>h(uint)</code> on any other contract will use a
<code>NONDET</code> summary.</p>
<p>Summaries for specific contract methods (including the default
<code>currentContract</code>) always override wildcard summaries.</p>
<p>Wildcard entries cannot be declared <code>optional</code> or <code>envfree</code>, since these
annotations only make sense for specific contract methods.</p>
<p><code>{warning}
The meaning of your summarizations will change from CVL 1 to CVL 2.  In CVL 2,
any entry without an `_` will only apply to a single contract!
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-returns)=</p>
<h3>Requirements on <code>returns</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 1, the <code>returns</code> clause on methods block entries was optional.
CVL 2 has stricter requirements on the declared return types.</p>
<p>Entries that apply to specific contracts (i.e. those that don't use the
<code>_.f</code> {ref}<code>syntax &lt;cvl2-wildcards&gt;</code>) must include a <code>returns</code> clause if the
contract method returns a value.  A specific-contract entry may only omit the
<code>returns</code> clause if the contract method does not return a value.</p>
<p>The Prover will report an error if the contract method's return type differs
from the type declared in the <code>methods</code> block entry.</p>
<p>Wildcard entries must not declare return types, because they may apply to
multiple methods that return different types.  If a wildcard entry is summarized
with a ghost or function summary, the summary must include an <code>expect</code> clause;
see {ref}<code>function-summary</code> for more details.</p>
<p>(cvl2-integer-types)=</p>
<h2>Changes to integer types</h2>
<p>In CVL 1, the rules for casting between integer types were complex; CVL 2
simplifies them.</p>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that you should use <code>mathint</code> whenever possible;
only use <code>uint</code> or <code>int</code> types for data that will be passed as input to
contract functions.</p>
<p>It is now impossible for CVL math expressions to cause overflow - all integer
operations are exact.
The remainder of this section describes the changes in detail.</p>
<p>(cvl2-mathops-return-mathint)=</p>
<h3>Mathematical operations return <code>mathint</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 2, the results of all arithmetic operators have type <code>mathint</code>,
regardless of the input types.  Arithmetic operators include <code>+</code>,
<code>*</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>^</code>, and <code>%</code>, but not bitwise operators like <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>|</code>
(changes to bitwise operators are described {ref}<code>below &lt;cvl2-bitwise&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>The primary impact of this change is that you may need to declare more of your
variables as <code>mathint</code> instead of <code>uint</code>.  If you are passing the results of
arithmetic operations to contract functions, you will need to be more explicit
about the overflow behavior by using the {ref}<code>new casting operators
&lt;cvl2-casting&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>(cvl2-comparisons-identical-types)=</p>
<h3>Comparisons require identical types</h3>
<p>When comparing two integers using <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&gt;=</code>, CVL 2 will
require both sides of the equation to have identical types, and {ref}<code>implicit
casts &lt;cvl2-casting&gt;</code> will not be used.  Comparisons with number literals (e.g.
<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>) are allowed for any integer type.</p>
<p>If you do not have identical types (and cannot change one of your variables to
a <code>mathint</code>), the best solution is to use the special
<code>to_mathint</code> operator to convert both sides to <code>mathint</code>.  For example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
assert to_mathint(balanceOf(user)) == initial + deposit;
</code></p>
<p>Note that in this example, we do not need to cast the right hand side, since
the result of <code>+</code> is always of type <code>mathint</code>.</p>
<p>```<code>{note}
When should you not simply cast to</code>mathint`?  We have one example: consider the
following code:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost uint256 sum;</p>
<p>hook ... {
    havoc sum assuming sum@new == sum@old + newBalance - oldBalance;
}
```</p>
<p>Simply casting to <code>mathint</code> will turn overflows into vacuity.</p>
<p>In this particular example, the right solution is to declare <code>sum</code> to be a
<code>mathint</code> instead of a <code>uint</code>.  Note that with the more recent update syntax,
this problem will correctly be reported as an error.  For example, if you
mistakenly write the following:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost uint256 sum;</p>
<p>hook ... {
    sum = sum + newBalance - oldBalance;
}
```</p>
<p>then the Prover will again report a type error, but the only available solutions
are to change <code>sum</code> to a <code>mathint</code> (which would prevent the vacuity) or write
an explicit <code>assert</code> or <code>require</code> cast (which would make the vacuity explicit).
````</p>
<p>(cvl2-casting)=</p>
<h3>Implicit and explicit casting</h3>
<p>If every number that can be represented by one type can also be represented by
another type, then we say that the first type is a <em>subtype</em> of the second type.</p>
<p>For example, a <code>uint8</code> variable could have any value between <code>0</code> and <code>2^8-1</code>,
and all of these values can be stored in a <code>uint16</code> variable, so <code>uint8</code> is a
subtype of <code>uint16</code>.  An <code>int16</code> can also store any value between <code>0</code> and
<code>2^8-1</code>, so <code>uint8</code> is also a subtype of <code>int16</code>.</p>
<p>All integer types are subtypes of <code>mathint</code>, since any integer can be
represented by a <code>mathint</code>.</p>
<p>In CVL 1, the rules for converting between supertypes and subtypes were
complicated; they depended not only on the types involved, but on the context
in which the conversion happened.  CVL 2 simplifies these rules and improves the
clarity and predictability of casts.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, with one exception, you can always use a subtype whenever the
supertype is accepted.  For example, you can always use a <code>uint8</code> where an
<code>int16</code> is expected.  We say that the subtype can be "implicitly cast" to the
supertype.</p>
<p>The one exception is comparison operators; as mentioned {ref}<code>above &lt;cvl2-mathops-return-mathint&gt;</code>, you must add an
explicit conversion if you want to compare two numbers with different types.
The <code>to_mathint</code> operator exists solely for this purpose; in all other contexts
you can simply use any number when a <code>mathint</code> is expected (since all integer
types are subtypes of <code>mathint</code>).</p>
<p>In order to convert from a supertype to a subtype, you must use an explicit
cast.  In CVL 1, only a few casting operators (such as <code>to_uint256</code>) were
supported.</p>
<p>CVL 2 replaces these casting operators with two new casting operators: <em>assert casts</em>
such as <code>assert_uint8(x)</code> or <code>assert_int256(x)</code>, and <em>require casts</em> such as <code>require_uint8(x)</code> or <code>require_int256(x)</code>.
Each of these casts checks that the value is in range; the <code>assert</code> cast will
report a counterexample if the value is out of range, while the <code>require</code> cast
will ignore counterexamples where the cast value is out of range.</p>
<p><code>{warning}
As with normal `require` statements, require casts can cause vacuity and should
be used with care.
</code></p>
<p>CVL 2 supports assert and require casts on all numeric types.</p>
<p>Casts from <code>address</code> or <code>bytes1</code>...<code>bytes32</code> to integer types are not
supported (see {ref}<code>bytesN-support</code> regarding casting in the other direction, and {ref}<code>enum-casting</code> for information on casting
enums).</p>
<p><code>require</code> and <code>assert</code> casts are not allowed anywhere inside of a
{term}<code>quantified statement &lt;quantifier&gt;</code>.  You can work around this limitation
by adding a second variable.  For example, the following axiom is invalid
because <code>x+1</code> is not a <code>uint</code>:</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost mapping(uint =&gt; uint) a {
    axiom forall uint x . a[x+1] == 0
}
</code></p>
<p>However, it can be replaced with the following:</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost mapping(uint =&gt; uint) a {
    axiom forall uint x . forall uint y . (to_mathint(y) == x + 1) =&gt; a[y] == 0
}
</code></p>
<p>(enum-casting)=</p>
<h3>Casting enums to integer types</h3>
<p>In CVL2 enums are not directly comparable to the corresponding integer type (<code>uint8</code>). Instead one must use one of the new cast
operators. For example</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint8 x = MyContract.MyEnum.VAL; // will fail typechecking
uint8 x = assert_uint8(MyContract.MyEnum.VAL); // good
mathint x = to_mathint(MyContract.MyEnum.VAL); // good
</code></p>
<p>Casting integer types to an enum is not supported.</p>
<p>(address-casting)=</p>
<h3>Casting addresses to bytes32</h3>
<p>CVL2 supports casting from the <code>address</code> type to the <code>bytes32</code> type. For
example: </p>
<p><code>cvl
address a = 0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d;
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(a);
</code></p>
<p>The cast from <code>address</code> to <code>bytes32</code> behaves equivalently to the Solidity
code:</p>
<p><code>solidity
address a = 0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d;
bytes32 b = bytes32(uint256(uint160(a)));
</code></p>
<p>Among other things, this behavior means that the resulting <code>bytes32</code>
value is right-aligned and zero-padded to the left.</p>
<p>CVL2 also supports casting from the <code>bytes32</code> type to the <code>address</code> type
using either the <code>require_address()</code> or <code>assert_address()</code> cast functions.</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d);
address a = assert_address(b);
</code></p>
<p>Note that <code>require_address()</code> will silently allow a cast to continue
when the <code>bytes32</code> variable contains a value that lies in the range
<code>2^160 &lt; var &lt; 2^256</code>. The <code>assert_address()</code> cast function will fail
when the <code>bytes32</code> variable contains a value in that same range.</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d0e); // Note this contains one extra byte
address a = require_address(b);                                       // Silently does the cast.
</code></p>
<p>While when using <code>assert_address</code>:</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d0e); // Note this contains one extra byte
address a = assert_address(b);                                       // This will fail.
</code></p>
<p>Casting from <code>bytes32</code> to <code>address</code> behaves equivalently to the Solidity
code:</p>
<p><code>solidity
bytes32 b = bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d);
address a = address(uint160(uint256(b)));
</code></p>
<h3>Modulo operator <code>%</code> returns negative values for negative inputs</h3>
<p>As in Solidity, if <code>n &lt; 0</code> then <code>n % k == -(-n % k)</code>.</p>
<p>(bytesN-support)=</p>
<h3>Support for <code>bytes1</code>...<code>bytes32</code></h3>
<p>CVL 2 supports the types <code>bytes1</code>, <code>bytes2</code>, ..., <code>bytes32</code>, as in Solidity.
Number literals must be explicitly cast to these types using <code>to_bytesN</code>; for
example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 x = to_bytes32(0);
</code></p>
<p>Unlike Solidity, <code>bytes1</code>...<code>bytes32</code> literals do not need to be written in hex
or padded to the correct length.</p>
<p>The only conversion between integer types and these types is from <code>uint&lt;i*8&gt;</code> to
<code>bytes&lt;i&gt;</code> (i.e. unsigned integers with the same bitwidth as the target <code>bytes&lt;i&gt;</code> type);
For example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint24 u;
bytes3 x = to_bytes3(u); // This is OK
bytes4 y = to_bytes4(u); // This will fail
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-bitwise)=</p>
<h3>Changes for bitwise operations</h3>
<p>In CVL1, the exact details for bitwise operations (such as <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code>) were not
completely specified, especially for negative integers.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, all bitwise operations (<code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and <code>xor</code>)
on integer types first convert to a 256 bit word, then perform the operations
on the full 256-bit word, then convert back to the expected type.  Signed
integer types use twos-complement encoding.</p>
<p>The two right-shifts differ in how they treat signed integers.  <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is an
arithmetic shift; it preserves the sign bit.  <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is a logical shift; it pads
the shifted word with zero.</p>
<p>Bitwise operations cannot be performed on <code>mathint</code> values.</p>
<p>``<code>{note}
By default, bitwise operators are {term}</code>overapproximated <overapproximation><code>
(in both CVL 1 and CVL 2), so you may see counterexamples that incorrectly
compute the results of bitwise operations.  The approximations are still
{term}</code>sound`: the Prover will not report a rule as verified if the original
code does not satisfy the rule.</overapproximation></p>
<p>The {ref}<code>--precise_bitwise_ops</code> flag makes the Prover's reasoning about bitwise
operations more precise, but this flag is experimental in CVL 2.
```</p>
<p>(cvl2-fallback-changes)=</p>
<h2>Changes to the fallback function</h2>
<p>In CVL 1, you could determine whether a <code>method</code> object was the fallback function
by comparing its selector to <code>certorafallback().selector</code>:</p>
<p><code>cvl
assert f.selector == certorafallback().selector,
    "f must be the fallback";
</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2, <code>certorafallback()</code> is no longer valid.  Instead, you can use the new
field <code>f.isFallback</code> to detect the fallback method:</p>
<p><code>cvl
assert f.isFallback,
    "f must be the fallback";
</code></p>
<h2>Removed features</h2>
<p>As we transit to CVL 2, we have removed several language features
that are no longer used.</p>
<p>We have removed these features because we think they are no longer used and no
longer useful.  If you find that you do need one of these features, contact
Certora support.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-sighashes)=</p>
<h3>Methods entries for sighashes</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could write a sighash instead of a method identifier in the
<code>methods</code> block.  This feature is no longer supported.  You will need to have
the name and argument types of the called method in order to provide an entry.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-invoke)=</p>
<h3><code>invoke</code>, <code>sinvoke</code>, and <code>call</code></h3>
<p>Older versions of CVL had special syntax for calling contract and CVL functions:
 - <code>invoke f(args);</code> should be replaced with <code>f@withrevert(args);</code>.
 - <code>sinvoke f(args);</code> should be replaced with <code>f(args);</code>.
 - <code>call f(args)</code> should be replaced with <code>f(args)</code>.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-static-assert-require)=</p>
<h3><code>static_assert</code> and <code>static_require</code></h3>
<p>These deprecated aliases for <code>assert</code> and <code>require</code> are being removed; replace
them with <code>assert</code> and <code>require</code> respectively.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-fallback)=</p>
<h3><code>invoke_fallback</code> and <code>certorafallback()</code></h3>
<p>The <code>invoke_fallback</code> syntax is no longer supported; there is no longer a way
to directly invoke the fallback method.  You can work around this limitation by
writing a parametric rule and filtering on <code>f.isFallback</code>.  See
{ref}<code>cvl2-fallback-changes</code>.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-invoke-whole)=</p>
<h3><code>invoke_whole</code></h3>
<p>The <code>invoke_whole</code> keyword is no longer supported.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-havoc)=</p>
<h3>Havocing local variables</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could write the following:</p>
<p>```cvl
calldataarg args; env e;
f(e, args);</p>
<p>havoc args;
g(e, args);
```</p>
<p>In CVL 2, you can only <code>havoc</code> ghost variables and ghost functions.  Instead of
havocing a local variable, replace the havoced variable with a new variable. For
example, you should replace the above with</p>
<p>```cvl
calldataarg args; env e;
f(e,args);</p>
<p>calldataarg args2;
g(e,args2);
```</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-destructure-struct)=</p>
<h3>Destructuring syntax for struct returns</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, if a contract function returned a struct, you could use a
destructuring syntax to get the return value in your spec.  For example,
consider the following contract:</p>
<p>```solidity
contract Example {
    struct S {
        uint firstField;
        uint secondField;
        bool thirdField;
    }</p>
<pre><code>function f() returns(S) { ... }
function g() returns(uint, uint) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>To access the return value of <code>f</code> in CVL 1, you could write the following:</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint x; uint y; bool z;
x, y, z = f();
</code></p>
<p>This syntax is no longer supported.  Instead, you should declare a variable with
the struct type:</p>
<p><code>cvl
Example.S result = f();
uint x = result.firstField;
</code></p>
<p>Destructuring assignments are still allowed for functions that return multiple
values; the following is valid:</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint x; uint y;
x, y = g();
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-double-arrays)=</p>
<h3><code>bytes[]</code> and <code>string[]</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could declare variables of type <code>string[]</code> and <code>bytes[]</code>.  You can
no longer use these types in CVL.</p>
<p>You can still declare contract methods that use these types in the <code>methods</code>
block.  However, you can only call methods that take one of these types as an
argument by passing a <code>calldataarg</code> variable, and you cannot access the return
value of a method that returns one of these types.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-pragma)=</p>
<h3><code>pragma</code></h3>
<p>CVL 1 had a <code>pragma</code> command for specifying the CVL version, but this feature
was not used and has been removed in CVL 2.</p>
<h3><code>events</code></h3>
<p>CVL 1 had syntax for an <code>events</code> block, but it did nothing and has been removed.</p>
<h2>Changes to the Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>
<p>As part of the transition to CVL 2 changes were made to enhanced clarity,
uniformity, and readability on the Command-Line Interface (CLI). 
The complete CLI specification can be found <a href="../../prover/cli/options.md">here</a></p>
<p><code>{note}
The changes will take effect starting v4.3.1 of `certora-cli`.
</code></p>
<p><code>{note}
To opt-out of the new CLI, one can set an environment variable `CERTORA_OLD_API` to `1`, e.g.:
`export CERTORA_OLD_API=1`.
**The old CLI will not be available in versions released after August 31st, 2023**
</code></p>
<h3>Flags Renaming</h3>
<p>In CVL 2 some flags were renamed:
1. flags with names that are generic or wrong
2. flags that do not match their corresponding key in the <code>conf</code> file
3. flags that do not follow the snake case format</p>
<p>This is the list of the flags that were renamed:</p>
<p>| CVL 1            | CVL 2                 |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| <code>--settings</code>     | <code>--prover_args</code>       |
| <code>--path</code>         | <code>--solc_allow_path</code>   |
| <code>--optimize</code>     | <code>--solc_optimize</code>     |
| <code>--optimize_map</code> | <code>--solc_optimize_map</code> |
| <code>--get_conf</code>     | <code>--conf_output_file</code>  |
| <code>--assert</code>       | <code>--assert_contracts</code>  |
| <code>--bytecode</code>     | <code>--bytecode_jsons</code>    |
| <code>--toolOutput</code>   | <code>--tool_output</code>       |
| <code>--structLink</code>   | <code>--struct_link</code>       |<br/>
| <code>--javaArgs</code>     | <code>--java_args</code>         |              </p>
<h3><code>Prover Args</code></h3>
<p><code>Prover args</code> are CLI flags that are sent to the Prover. <code>Prover args</code> can be set in one of two ways:
1. Using specific CLI flags (e.g. <code>--loop_iter</code>)
2. As parameters to the <code>--prover_args</code> (<code>--settings</code> in CVL 1)</p>
<p>Unlike CVL 1, if a <code>prover arg</code> is set using a specific CLI flag it cannot be set
using <code>--prover_args</code>. In addition, the value commas and equal signs separators that were used in <code>--settings</code> 
were replaced with white-spaces
in <code>--prover_args</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Consider this call to <code>certoraRun</code> using CVL 1 syntax
<code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --settings -smt_bitVectorTheory=true,-smt_hashingScheme=plainInjectivity,-assumeUnwindCond
</code></p>
<p>In order to convert this call to CVL 2 we:
1. renamed <code>--settings</code> to <code>--prover_args</code>
2. replaced <code>-assumeUnwindCond</code> with the flag <code>--optimistic_loop</code>
3. removed the comma and equal sign separators</p>
<p><code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --optimistic_loop \
    --prover_args '-smt_bitVectorTheory true -smt_hashingScheme plainInjectivity'
</code></p>
<h3><code>Solidity Compiler Args</code></h3>
<p>The <code>Solidity Compiler Args</code> are CLI flags that are sent to the Solidity compiler. The behavior of the <code>Solidity Args</code> is similar to <code>Prover
Args</code>. The flag <code>--solc_args</code> can only be used if there is no CLI flag that sets the Solidity flag and the value of <code>--solc_args</code> is 
a string that is sent as is to the Solidity compiler.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Consider this call to <code>certoraRun</code> using CVL 1 syntax
<code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --solc_args "['--optimize', '--optimize-runs', '200', '--experimental-via-ir']"
</code>
In CVL 2 calling optimize is using <code>--solc_optimize</code></p>
<p><code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --solc_optimize 200 \
    --solc_args "--experimental-via-ir"
</code></p>
<h3>Enhanced server support</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, two server platforms were supported:
1. <code>staging</code> was set using the flag <code>--staging [Branch/hotfix]</code>
2. <code>production</code> was set using the flag <code>--cloud [Branch/hotfix]</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2 the flag <code>--server</code> was added to replace <code>--staging</code> <code>--cloud</code> and to allow adding additional server platforms.
<code>--server</code> gets as a parameter the platform name.
<code>--prover_version</code> is a new flag in CVL 2 For setting the Branch/hot-fix</p>

<p>CVL 2 is a major overhaul to the type system of CVL. Though many
of the changes are internal, we wanted to take this opportunity to
introduce a few improvements to the syntax.  The general goal of these changes
is to make the behavior of CVL more explicit and predictable, and to bring the
syntax more in line with Solidity's syntax.</p>
<p>This document summarizes the changes to CVL syntax introduced by CVL 2.</p>
<p>The <code>CVLMigration</code> repository contains examples demonstrating each of the
changes; the <code>cvl1</code> branch contains the examples in valid CVL 1 syntax, while
the <code>cvl2</code> branch contains the same examples in CVL 2 syntax.  You can see the
differences <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split">here</a>, our you can clone <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration">the
repository</a> and compare the <code>cvl1</code> and <code>cvl2</code> branches using
your favorite tools.</p>

<p>(cvl2-superficial-syntax-changes)=</p>
<h2>Superficial syntax changes</h2>
<p>There are several simple changes to the syntax to make specs more uniform and
consistent, and to reduce the superficial differences with Solidity.</p>
<h3><code>function</code> and <code>;</code> required for methods block entries</h3>
<p>In CVL 2, methods block entries must now start with <code>function</code> and end with
<code>;</code> (semicolons were optional in CVL 1).  For example
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-9cd1ae6f2c8146e323568cb25c79d4f6671fcb690872dce33591bd514759fc24">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
transferFrom(address, address, uint) returns(bool) envfree
</code>
will become
<code>cvl
function transferFrom(address, address, uint) external returns(bool) envfree;
</code>
(note also the addition of <code>external</code>, {ref}<code>described below &lt;cvl2-visibility&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>This is also true for entries with summaries:
<code>cvl
balanceOf(address) returns(uint256) =&gt; ALWAYS(3)
</code>
will become
<code>cvl
function balanceOf(address) external returns(uint256) =&gt; ALWAYS(3);
</code></p>
<p>If you do not change this, you will get an error message like the following:
<code>
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec:4:5: Syntax error: unexpected token near ID(transferFrom)
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/MethodsEntries.spec:4:5: Couldn't repair and continue parse unexpected token near ID(transferFrom)
</code></p>
<h3>Required <code>;</code> in more places</h3>
<p><code>using</code>, <code>import</code>, <code>use</code>, and <code>invariant</code> statements all require a <code>;</code> at the
end.  For example
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/Semicolons.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/Semicolons.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-15fb1ef5e6524f8a661d83ae5160b6b072840c5c54bf8d07733aab32b9da73f7">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
invariant balanceOfZeroIsZero()
    balanceOf(0) == 0
</code></p>
<p>becomes
<code>cvl
invariant balanceOfZeroIsZero()
    balanceOf(0) == 0;
</code></p>
<p><code>use</code> and <code>invariant</code> statements do not require (and may not have) a semicolon
if they are followed by a <code>preserved</code> or <code>filtered</code> block.  For example, the
following is valid in both CVL 1 and CVL 2:</p>
<p><code>cvl
invariant totalSupplyBoundsBalance(address a)
    balanceOf(a) &lt;= totalSupply()
    { preserved { require false; } }
</code></p>
<p>If you do not change this, you will see an error like the following:
<code>
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/Semicolons.spec:5:1: Syntax error: unexpected token near using
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/Semicolons.spec:5:1: Couldn't repair and continue parse unexpected token near using
</code></p>
<h3>Method literals require <code>sig:</code></h3>
<p>In some places in CVL, you can refer to a contract method by its name and
argument types.  For example, you might write
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/MethodLiterals.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/MethodLiterals.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-41df8240fa5faa12531baa82863891b94abf3fb3b859bdd10bafde73b60eda5d">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
f.selector == approve(address, uint).selector
</code></p>
<p>In this example, <code>approve(address,uint)</code> is a <em>method literal</em>.  In CVL 2,
these methods literals must now start with <code>sig:</code>.  For example, the above
would become:</p>
<p><code>cvl
f.selector == sig:approve(address, uint).selector
</code></p>
<p>If you do not change this, you will see the following error:
<code>
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:14:5): Variable address is undefined (first instance only reported)
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:14:5): Variable uint is undefined (first instance only reported)
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:15:34): could not type expression "address", message: unknown variable "address"
Error: Error in spec file (MethodLiterals.spec:15:43): could not type expression "uint", message: unknown variable "uint"
</code></p>
<h3>Use of contract name instead of <code>using</code> variable</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, the only way to refer to a contract in the {term}<code>scene</code> was to first
introduce a contract instance variable with a <code>using</code> statement, and then use
that variable.  For example, to access a struct type <code>S</code> defined in
<code>PrimaryContract.sol</code>, you would need to write
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/ContractNames.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/ContractNames.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-a6a2974b81074e87d755753c2e84ef1b0cb553bfdeb729827959e0c63f0d02d7">diff</a>):</p>
<p>```cvl
using PrimaryContract as primary;</p>
<p>rule structExample {
    primary.S x;
    ...
}
```</p>
<p>In CVL 2, you must now use the name of the contract, rather than the instance
variable, when referring to user-defined types.  The above example would now be
written</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule structExample {
    PrimaryContract.S x;
    ...
}
</code></p>
<p>There is no need for a <code>using</code> statement in this example.</p>
<p>If you don't change this, you will an error like the following:
<code>
Error: Error in spec file (ContractNames.spec:12:19): Contract name primary does not exist in the scene. Make sure you are using a contract name and not a contract instance name.
</code></p>
<p>Calling methods on secondary contracts still requires using a contract instance
variable:</p>
<p>```cvl
using SecondaryContract as secondary;</p>
<p>rule multicontractExample {
    ...
    secondary.balanceOf(0);
    ...
}
```</p>
<p>Entries in the <code>methods</code> block may use either the contract name or an instance
variable:</p>
<p>```cvl
using SecondaryContract as secondary;</p>
<p>methods {
    //// both are valid (and the effect is the same):
    secondary.balanceOf(address) returns(uint) envfree
    SecondaryContract.transfer(address, uint) returns(bool) envfree
}
```</p>
<p>Using the contract name in the methods block currently has the same effect as
using an instance variable; this may change in future versions of CVL.</p>
<h3>Rules must start with <code>rule</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could omit the keyword <code>rule</code> when writing rules
(<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl1/certora/spec/RuleKeyword.spec">CVL 1</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/blob/cvl2/certora/spec/RuleKeyword.spec">CVL 2</a>, <a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-b39a57bffd39f86bc1f9555a487af389f501eab9e66a1c3059a89691319da248">diff</a>):</p>
<p><code>cvl
transferReverts {
    ...
}
</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2, the <code>rule</code> keyword is no longer optional:</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule transferReverts {
    ...
}
</code></p>
<p>If you don't change this, you will receive an error like the following:
<code>
CRITICAL: [main] ERROR ALWAYS - certora/spec/RuleKeyword.spec:3:1: Syntax error: unexpected token near ID(transferReverts)
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-methods-blocks)=</p>
<h2>Changes to methods block entries</h2>
<p>In addition to the superficial changes listed above, there are some changes to
the way that methods block entries can be written (there are also a
{ref}<code>few instances &lt;cvl2-wildcards&gt;</code> where the meanings of entries has
changed).  In CVL 1, <code>methods</code> block entries often had several different
functions and meanings:</p>
<ul>
<li>They were used to indicate targets for summarization</li>
<li>They were used to write generic specs that could apply to contracts with
missing methods</li>
<li>They were used to declare targets <code>envfree</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The changes described in this section make these different uses more explicit:</p>
<p><code>{contents}
:local:
:depth: 1
</code></p>
<h3>Most Solidity types allowed as arguments</h3>
<p>CVL 1 had some restrictions on the types of arguments allowed in <code>methods</code> block
entries.  For example, user-defined types (such as enums and structs) were not
fully supported.</p>
<p>CVL 2 <code>methods</code> block entries may use any Solidity types for arguments and
return values, except for <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/types.html#function-types">function types</a> and contract or
interface types.</p>
<p>To work around the missing types, CVL 1 allowed users to encode some
user-defined types as primitive types in the <code>methods</code> block; these workarounds
are no longer allowed in CVL 2.  For example, consider the following <a href="https://TODO/">solidity
function</a>:</p>
<p>```solidity
contract Example {
    enum Permission { READ, WRITE };</p>
<pre><code>function f(Permission p) internal { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>In CVL 1, a methods block entry for <code>f</code> would need to declare that it takes a
<code>uint8</code> argument:</p>
<p><code>cvl
methods {
    f(uint8 permission) =&gt; NONDET
}
</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2, the methods block entry should use the same type as the Solidity
implementations[^contract-types] (<a href="https://github.com/Certora/CVL2Migration/compare/cvl1..cvl2?diff=split#diff-5b1b684b999817bab176753b548b9ca548c8e9a1b7ce72d355030a8e03f498d8">compare files</a>),
except for function types and contract or interface types:</p>
<p><code>cvl
methods {
    function f(Example.Permission p) internal =&gt; NONDET;
}
</code>
The method can be called from CVL as follows:
<code>cvl
rule example {
    f(Example.Permission.READ);
}
</code></p>
<p>Contract functions that take or return contract or interface types should
instead use <code>address</code> in the <code>methods</code> block declaration.  For example, if the
contract contains the following function:</p>
<p><code>solidity
function listToken(IERC20 token) internal { ... }
</code></p>
<p>the <code>methods</code> block should use <code>address</code> for the <code>token</code> argument:</p>
<p><code>cvl
methods {
    function listToken(address token) internal;
}
</code></p>
<p>Contract functions that take or return function types are not currently
supported.</p>

<h3>Required <code>internal</code> or <code>external</code> annotation</h3>
<p>Every methods block entry must be marked either <code>internal</code> or <code>external</code>.  The
annotation must come after the argument list and before the <code>returns</code> clause.</p>
<p>If a function is declared <code>public</code> in Solidity, then the Solidity compiler
creates an internal implementation method, and an external wrapper method that
calls the internal implementation.  Therefore, you can summarize a <code>public</code>
method by marking the summarization <code>internal</code>.</p>
<p><code>{warning}
The behavior of `internal` vs. `external` summarization for public methods can
be confusing, especially because functions called directly from CVL are not
summarized.  See {ref}`methods-visibility`.
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-optional)=</p>
<h3><code>optional</code> methods block entries</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could write an entry in the methods block for a method that does
not exist in the contract; rules that would call the non-existent method were
skipped during verification.</p>
<p>This behavior can lead to confusion, because typos or name changes could silently
cause a rule to be skipped.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, this behavior is still available, but the methods entry must contain
the keyword <code>optional</code> somewhere after the <code>returns</code> clause and before the
summarization (if any).</p>
<p>(cvl2-locations)=</p>
<h3>Required <code>calldata</code>, <code>memory</code>, or <code>storage</code> annotations for reference types</h3>
<p>In CVL 2, methods block entries for internal functions must contain either <code>calldata</code>,
<code>memory</code>, or <code>storage</code> annotations for all arguments with reference types (such
as arrays).</p>
<p>For methods block entries of external functions the location annotation must be
omitted unless it's the <code>storage</code> annotation on an external library function, in
which case it is required (the reasoning here is to have the information required
in order to correctly calculate a function's sighash).</p>
<p>(cvl2-wildcards)=</p>
<h3>Summaries only apply to one contract by default</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, a summary in the <code>methods</code> block applied to all methods with the
given signature.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, summaries only apply to a single contract, unless the old behavior is
explicitly requested by using <code>_</code> as the receiver.  If no contract is specified,
the default is <code>currentContract</code>.</p>
<p><code>{note}
The receiver contract must be the contract where the method is defined.  If a
contract inherits a method defined in a supercontract, the receiver must be the
supercontract, rather than the inheriting contract.
</code></p>
<p>Entries that use <code>_</code> as the receiver are called {term}<code>wildcard entries &lt;wildcard&gt;</code>, summaries
that do not are called {term}<code>exact entries &lt;exact&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Consider the following example:
```cvl
using C as c;</p>
<p>methods {
    function f(uint)   internal =&gt; NONDET;
    function c.g(uint) internal =&gt; ALWAYS(4);
    function h(uint)   internal =&gt; ALWAYS(1);
    function _.h(uint) internal =&gt; NONDET;
}
```</p>
<p>In this example, the internal function <code>currentContract.f</code> has a <code>NONDET</code>
summary, <code>c.g</code> has an <code>ALWAYS</code> summary, a call to <code>currentContact.h</code> has an
<code>ALWAYS</code> summary and a call to <code>h(uint)</code> on any other contract will use a
<code>NONDET</code> summary.</p>
<p>Summaries for specific contract methods (including the default
<code>currentContract</code>) always override wildcard summaries.</p>
<p>Wildcard entries cannot be declared <code>optional</code> or <code>envfree</code>, since these
annotations only make sense for specific contract methods.</p>
<p><code>{warning}
The meaning of your summarizations will change from CVL 1 to CVL 2.  In CVL 2,
any entry without an `_` will only apply to a single contract!
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-returns)=</p>
<h3>Requirements on <code>returns</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 1, the <code>returns</code> clause on methods block entries was optional.
CVL 2 has stricter requirements on the declared return types.</p>
<p>Entries that apply to specific contracts (i.e. those that don't use the
<code>_.f</code> {ref}<code>syntax &lt;cvl2-wildcards&gt;</code>) must include a <code>returns</code> clause if the
contract method returns a value.  A specific-contract entry may only omit the
<code>returns</code> clause if the contract method does not return a value.</p>
<p>The Prover will report an error if the contract method's return type differs
from the type declared in the <code>methods</code> block entry.</p>
<p>Wildcard entries must not declare return types, because they may apply to
multiple methods that return different types.  If a wildcard entry is summarized
with a ghost or function summary, the summary must include an <code>expect</code> clause;
see {ref}<code>function-summary</code> for more details.</p>
<p>(cvl2-integer-types)=</p>
<h2>Changes to integer types</h2>
<p>In CVL 1, the rules for casting between integer types were complex; CVL 2
simplifies them.</p>
<p>The general rule of thumb is that you should use <code>mathint</code> whenever possible;
only use <code>uint</code> or <code>int</code> types for data that will be passed as input to
contract functions.</p>
<p>It is now impossible for CVL math expressions to cause overflow - all integer
operations are exact.
The remainder of this section describes the changes in detail.</p>
<p>(cvl2-mathops-return-mathint)=</p>
<h3>Mathematical operations return <code>mathint</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 2, the results of all arithmetic operators have type <code>mathint</code>,
regardless of the input types.  Arithmetic operators include <code>+</code>,
<code>*</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>/</code>, <code>^</code>, and <code>%</code>, but not bitwise operators like <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>xor</code>, and <code>|</code>
(changes to bitwise operators are described {ref}<code>below &lt;cvl2-bitwise&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>The primary impact of this change is that you may need to declare more of your
variables as <code>mathint</code> instead of <code>uint</code>.  If you are passing the results of
arithmetic operations to contract functions, you will need to be more explicit
about the overflow behavior by using the {ref}<code>new casting operators
&lt;cvl2-casting&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>(cvl2-comparisons-identical-types)=</p>
<h3>Comparisons require identical types</h3>
<p>When comparing two integers using <code>==</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, or <code>&gt;=</code>, CVL 2 will
require both sides of the equation to have identical types, and {ref}<code>implicit
casts &lt;cvl2-casting&gt;</code> will not be used.  Comparisons with number literals (e.g.
<code>0</code> or <code>1</code>) are allowed for any integer type.</p>
<p>If you do not have identical types (and cannot change one of your variables to
a <code>mathint</code>), the best solution is to use the special
<code>to_mathint</code> operator to convert both sides to <code>mathint</code>.  For example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
assert to_mathint(balanceOf(user)) == initial + deposit;
</code></p>
<p>Note that in this example, we do not need to cast the right hand side, since
the result of <code>+</code> is always of type <code>mathint</code>.</p>
<p>```<code>{note}
When should you not simply cast to</code>mathint`?  We have one example: consider the
following code:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost uint256 sum;</p>
<p>hook ... {
    havoc sum assuming sum@new == sum@old + newBalance - oldBalance;
}
```</p>
<p>Simply casting to <code>mathint</code> will turn overflows into vacuity.</p>
<p>In this particular example, the right solution is to declare <code>sum</code> to be a
<code>mathint</code> instead of a <code>uint</code>.  Note that with the more recent update syntax,
this problem will correctly be reported as an error.  For example, if you
mistakenly write the following:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost uint256 sum;</p>
<p>hook ... {
    sum = sum + newBalance - oldBalance;
}
```</p>
<p>then the Prover will again report a type error, but the only available solutions
are to change <code>sum</code> to a <code>mathint</code> (which would prevent the vacuity) or write
an explicit <code>assert</code> or <code>require</code> cast (which would make the vacuity explicit).
````</p>
<p>(cvl2-casting)=</p>
<h3>Implicit and explicit casting</h3>
<p>If every number that can be represented by one type can also be represented by
another type, then we say that the first type is a <em>subtype</em> of the second type.</p>
<p>For example, a <code>uint8</code> variable could have any value between <code>0</code> and <code>2^8-1</code>,
and all of these values can be stored in a <code>uint16</code> variable, so <code>uint8</code> is a
subtype of <code>uint16</code>.  An <code>int16</code> can also store any value between <code>0</code> and
<code>2^8-1</code>, so <code>uint8</code> is also a subtype of <code>int16</code>.</p>
<p>All integer types are subtypes of <code>mathint</code>, since any integer can be
represented by a <code>mathint</code>.</p>
<p>In CVL 1, the rules for converting between supertypes and subtypes were
complicated; they depended not only on the types involved, but on the context
in which the conversion happened.  CVL 2 simplifies these rules and improves the
clarity and predictability of casts.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, with one exception, you can always use a subtype whenever the
supertype is accepted.  For example, you can always use a <code>uint8</code> where an
<code>int16</code> is expected.  We say that the subtype can be "implicitly cast" to the
supertype.</p>
<p>The one exception is comparison operators; as mentioned {ref}<code>above &lt;cvl2-mathops-return-mathint&gt;</code>, you must add an
explicit conversion if you want to compare two numbers with different types.
The <code>to_mathint</code> operator exists solely for this purpose; in all other contexts
you can simply use any number when a <code>mathint</code> is expected (since all integer
types are subtypes of <code>mathint</code>).</p>
<p>In order to convert from a supertype to a subtype, you must use an explicit
cast.  In CVL 1, only a few casting operators (such as <code>to_uint256</code>) were
supported.</p>
<p>CVL 2 replaces these casting operators with two new casting operators: <em>assert casts</em>
such as <code>assert_uint8(x)</code> or <code>assert_int256(x)</code>, and <em>require casts</em> such as <code>require_uint8(x)</code> or <code>require_int256(x)</code>.
Each of these casts checks that the value is in range; the <code>assert</code> cast will
report a counterexample if the value is out of range, while the <code>require</code> cast
will ignore counterexamples where the cast value is out of range.</p>
<p><code>{warning}
As with normal `require` statements, require casts can cause vacuity and should
be used with care.
</code></p>
<p>CVL 2 supports assert and require casts on all numeric types.</p>
<p>Casts from <code>address</code> or <code>bytes1</code>...<code>bytes32</code> to integer types are not
supported (see {ref}<code>bytesN-support</code> regarding casting in the other direction, and {ref}<code>enum-casting</code> for information on casting
enums).</p>
<p><code>require</code> and <code>assert</code> casts are not allowed anywhere inside of a
{term}<code>quantified statement &lt;quantifier&gt;</code>.  You can work around this limitation
by adding a second variable.  For example, the following axiom is invalid
because <code>x+1</code> is not a <code>uint</code>:</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost mapping(uint =&gt; uint) a {
    axiom forall uint x . a[x+1] == 0
}
</code></p>
<p>However, it can be replaced with the following:</p>
<p><code>cvl
ghost mapping(uint =&gt; uint) a {
    axiom forall uint x . forall uint y . (to_mathint(y) == x + 1) =&gt; a[y] == 0
}
</code></p>
<p>(enum-casting)=</p>
<h3>Casting enums to integer types</h3>
<p>In CVL2 enums are not directly comparable to the corresponding integer type (<code>uint8</code>). Instead one must use one of the new cast
operators. For example</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint8 x = MyContract.MyEnum.VAL; // will fail typechecking
uint8 x = assert_uint8(MyContract.MyEnum.VAL); // good
mathint x = to_mathint(MyContract.MyEnum.VAL); // good
</code></p>
<p>Casting integer types to an enum is not supported.</p>
<p>(address-casting)=</p>
<h3>Casting addresses to bytes32</h3>
<p>CVL2 supports casting from the <code>address</code> type to the <code>bytes32</code> type. For
example: </p>
<p><code>cvl
address a = 0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d;
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(a);
</code></p>
<p>The cast from <code>address</code> to <code>bytes32</code> behaves equivalently to the Solidity
code:</p>
<p><code>solidity
address a = 0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d;
bytes32 b = bytes32(uint256(uint160(a)));
</code></p>
<p>Among other things, this behavior means that the resulting <code>bytes32</code>
value is right-aligned and zero-padded to the left.</p>
<p>CVL2 also supports casting from the <code>bytes32</code> type to the <code>address</code> type
using either the <code>require_address()</code> or <code>assert_address()</code> cast functions.</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d);
address a = assert_address(b);
</code></p>
<p>Note that <code>require_address()</code> will silently allow a cast to continue
when the <code>bytes32</code> variable contains a value that lies in the range
<code>2^160 &lt; var &lt; 2^256</code>. The <code>assert_address()</code> cast function will fail
when the <code>bytes32</code> variable contains a value in that same range.</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d0e); // Note this contains one extra byte
address a = require_address(b);                                       // Silently does the cast.
</code></p>
<p>While when using <code>assert_address</code>:</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 b = to_bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d0e); // Note this contains one extra byte
address a = assert_address(b);                                       // This will fail.
</code></p>
<p>Casting from <code>bytes32</code> to <code>address</code> behaves equivalently to the Solidity
code:</p>
<p><code>solidity
bytes32 b = bytes32(0xa44f5d3d624DfD660ecc11FF777587AD0a19606d);
address a = address(uint160(uint256(b)));
</code></p>
<h3>Modulo operator <code>%</code> returns negative values for negative inputs</h3>
<p>As in Solidity, if <code>n &lt; 0</code> then <code>n % k == -(-n % k)</code>.</p>
<p>(bytesN-support)=</p>
<h3>Support for <code>bytes1</code>...<code>bytes32</code></h3>
<p>CVL 2 supports the types <code>bytes1</code>, <code>bytes2</code>, ..., <code>bytes32</code>, as in Solidity.
Number literals must be explicitly cast to these types using <code>to_bytesN</code>; for
example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
bytes32 x = to_bytes32(0);
</code></p>
<p>Unlike Solidity, <code>bytes1</code>...<code>bytes32</code> literals do not need to be written in hex
or padded to the correct length.</p>
<p>The only conversion between integer types and these types is from <code>uint&lt;i*8&gt;</code> to
<code>bytes&lt;i&gt;</code> (i.e. unsigned integers with the same bitwidth as the target <code>bytes&lt;i&gt;</code> type);
For example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint24 u;
bytes3 x = to_bytes3(u); // This is OK
bytes4 y = to_bytes4(u); // This will fail
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-bitwise)=</p>
<h3>Changes for bitwise operations</h3>
<p>In CVL1, the exact details for bitwise operations (such as <code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, and <code>&lt;&lt;</code>) were not
completely specified, especially for negative integers.</p>
<p>In CVL 2, all bitwise operations (<code>&amp;</code>, <code>|</code>, <code>~</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;&lt;</code>, and <code>xor</code>)
on integer types first convert to a 256 bit word, then perform the operations
on the full 256-bit word, then convert back to the expected type.  Signed
integer types use twos-complement encoding.</p>
<p>The two right-shifts differ in how they treat signed integers.  <code>&gt;&gt;</code> is an
arithmetic shift; it preserves the sign bit.  <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> is a logical shift; it pads
the shifted word with zero.</p>
<p>Bitwise operations cannot be performed on <code>mathint</code> values.</p>
<p>``<code>{note}
By default, bitwise operators are {term}</code>overapproximated <overapproximation><code>
(in both CVL 1 and CVL 2), so you may see counterexamples that incorrectly
compute the results of bitwise operations.  The approximations are still
{term}</code>sound`: the Prover will not report a rule as verified if the original
code does not satisfy the rule.</overapproximation></p>
<p>The {ref}<code>--precise_bitwise_ops</code> flag makes the Prover's reasoning about bitwise
operations more precise, but this flag is experimental in CVL 2.
```</p>
<p>(cvl2-fallback-changes)=</p>
<h2>Changes to the fallback function</h2>
<p>In CVL 1, you could determine whether a <code>method</code> object was the fallback function
by comparing its selector to <code>certorafallback().selector</code>:</p>
<p><code>cvl
assert f.selector == certorafallback().selector,
    "f must be the fallback";
</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2, <code>certorafallback()</code> is no longer valid.  Instead, you can use the new
field <code>f.isFallback</code> to detect the fallback method:</p>
<p><code>cvl
assert f.isFallback,
    "f must be the fallback";
</code></p>
<h2>Removed features</h2>
<p>As we transit to CVL 2, we have removed several language features
that are no longer used.</p>
<p>We have removed these features because we think they are no longer used and no
longer useful.  If you find that you do need one of these features, contact
Certora support.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-sighashes)=</p>
<h3>Methods entries for sighashes</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could write a sighash instead of a method identifier in the
<code>methods</code> block.  This feature is no longer supported.  You will need to have
the name and argument types of the called method in order to provide an entry.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-invoke)=</p>
<h3><code>invoke</code>, <code>sinvoke</code>, and <code>call</code></h3>
<p>Older versions of CVL had special syntax for calling contract and CVL functions:
 - <code>invoke f(args);</code> should be replaced with <code>f@withrevert(args);</code>.
 - <code>sinvoke f(args);</code> should be replaced with <code>f(args);</code>.
 - <code>call f(args)</code> should be replaced with <code>f(args)</code>.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-static-assert-require)=</p>
<h3><code>static_assert</code> and <code>static_require</code></h3>
<p>These deprecated aliases for <code>assert</code> and <code>require</code> are being removed; replace
them with <code>assert</code> and <code>require</code> respectively.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-fallback)=</p>
<h3><code>invoke_fallback</code> and <code>certorafallback()</code></h3>
<p>The <code>invoke_fallback</code> syntax is no longer supported; there is no longer a way
to directly invoke the fallback method.  You can work around this limitation by
writing a parametric rule and filtering on <code>f.isFallback</code>.  See
{ref}<code>cvl2-fallback-changes</code>.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-invoke-whole)=</p>
<h3><code>invoke_whole</code></h3>
<p>The <code>invoke_whole</code> keyword is no longer supported.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-havoc)=</p>
<h3>Havocing local variables</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could write the following:</p>
<p>```cvl
calldataarg args; env e;
f(e, args);</p>
<p>havoc args;
g(e, args);
```</p>
<p>In CVL 2, you can only <code>havoc</code> ghost variables and ghost functions.  Instead of
havocing a local variable, replace the havoced variable with a new variable. For
example, you should replace the above with</p>
<p>```cvl
calldataarg args; env e;
f(e,args);</p>
<p>calldataarg args2;
g(e,args2);
```</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-destructure-struct)=</p>
<h3>Destructuring syntax for struct returns</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, if a contract function returned a struct, you could use a
destructuring syntax to get the return value in your spec.  For example,
consider the following contract:</p>
<p>```solidity
contract Example {
    struct S {
        uint firstField;
        uint secondField;
        bool thirdField;
    }</p>
<pre><code>function f() returns(S) { ... }
function g() returns(uint, uint) { ... }
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>To access the return value of <code>f</code> in CVL 1, you could write the following:</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint x; uint y; bool z;
x, y, z = f();
</code></p>
<p>This syntax is no longer supported.  Instead, you should declare a variable with
the struct type:</p>
<p><code>cvl
Example.S result = f();
uint x = result.firstField;
</code></p>
<p>Destructuring assignments are still allowed for functions that return multiple
values; the following is valid:</p>
<p><code>cvl
uint x; uint y;
x, y = g();
</code></p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-double-arrays)=</p>
<h3><code>bytes[]</code> and <code>string[]</code></h3>
<p>In CVL 1, you could declare variables of type <code>string[]</code> and <code>bytes[]</code>.  You can
no longer use these types in CVL.</p>
<p>You can still declare contract methods that use these types in the <code>methods</code>
block.  However, you can only call methods that take one of these types as an
argument by passing a <code>calldataarg</code> variable, and you cannot access the return
value of a method that returns one of these types.</p>
<p>(cvl2-removed-pragma)=</p>
<h3><code>pragma</code></h3>
<p>CVL 1 had a <code>pragma</code> command for specifying the CVL version, but this feature
was not used and has been removed in CVL 2.</p>
<h3><code>events</code></h3>
<p>CVL 1 had syntax for an <code>events</code> block, but it did nothing and has been removed.</p>
<h2>Changes to the Command Line Interface (CLI)</h2>
<p>As part of the transition to CVL 2 changes were made to enhanced clarity,
uniformity, and readability on the Command-Line Interface (CLI). 
The complete CLI specification can be found <a href="../../prover/cli/options.md">here</a></p>
<p><code>{note}
The changes will take effect starting v4.3.1 of `certora-cli`.
</code></p>
<p><code>{note}
To opt-out of the new CLI, one can set an environment variable `CERTORA_OLD_API` to `1`, e.g.:
`export CERTORA_OLD_API=1`.
**The old CLI will not be available in versions released after August 31st, 2023**
</code></p>
<h3>Flags Renaming</h3>
<p>In CVL 2 some flags were renamed:
1. flags with names that are generic or wrong
2. flags that do not match their corresponding key in the <code>conf</code> file
3. flags that do not follow the snake case format</p>
<p>This is the list of the flags that were renamed:</p>
<p>| CVL 1            | CVL 2                 |
|------------------|-----------------------|
| <code>--settings</code>     | <code>--prover_args</code>       |
| <code>--path</code>         | <code>--solc_allow_path</code>   |
| <code>--optimize</code>     | <code>--solc_optimize</code>     |
| <code>--optimize_map</code> | <code>--solc_optimize_map</code> |
| <code>--get_conf</code>     | <code>--conf_output_file</code>  |
| <code>--assert</code>       | <code>--assert_contracts</code>  |
| <code>--bytecode</code>     | <code>--bytecode_jsons</code>    |
| <code>--toolOutput</code>   | <code>--tool_output</code>       |
| <code>--structLink</code>   | <code>--struct_link</code>       |<br/>
| <code>--javaArgs</code>     | <code>--java_args</code>         |              </p>
<h3><code>Prover Args</code></h3>
<p><code>Prover args</code> are CLI flags that are sent to the Prover. <code>Prover args</code> can be set in one of two ways:
1. Using specific CLI flags (e.g. <code>--loop_iter</code>)
2. As parameters to the <code>--prover_args</code> (<code>--settings</code> in CVL 1)</p>
<p>Unlike CVL 1, if a <code>prover arg</code> is set using a specific CLI flag it cannot be set
using <code>--prover_args</code>. In addition, the value commas and equal signs separators that were used in <code>--settings</code> 
were replaced with white-spaces
in <code>--prover_args</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Consider this call to <code>certoraRun</code> using CVL 1 syntax
<code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --settings -smt_bitVectorTheory=true,-smt_hashingScheme=plainInjectivity,-assumeUnwindCond
</code></p>
<p>In order to convert this call to CVL 2 we:
1. renamed <code>--settings</code> to <code>--prover_args</code>
2. replaced <code>-assumeUnwindCond</code> with the flag <code>--optimistic_loop</code>
3. removed the comma and equal sign separators</p>
<p><code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --optimistic_loop \
    --prover_args '-smt_bitVectorTheory true -smt_hashingScheme plainInjectivity'
</code></p>
<h3><code>Solidity Compiler Args</code></h3>
<p>The <code>Solidity Compiler Args</code> are CLI flags that are sent to the Solidity compiler. The behavior of the <code>Solidity Args</code> is similar to <code>Prover
Args</code>. The flag <code>--solc_args</code> can only be used if there is no CLI flag that sets the Solidity flag and the value of <code>--solc_args</code> is 
a string that is sent as is to the Solidity compiler.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>Consider this call to <code>certoraRun</code> using CVL 1 syntax
<code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --solc_args "['--optimize', '--optimize-runs', '200', '--experimental-via-ir']"
</code>
In CVL 2 calling optimize is using <code>--solc_optimize</code></p>
<p><code>bash
certoraRun Compound.sol \
    --verify Compound:Compound.spec  \
    --solc solc8.13 \
    --solc_optimize 200 \
    --solc_args "--experimental-via-ir"
</code></p>
<h3>Enhanced server support</h3>
<p>In CVL 1, two server platforms were supported:
1. <code>staging</code> was set using the flag <code>--staging [Branch/hotfix]</code>
2. <code>production</code> was set using the flag <code>--cloud [Branch/hotfix]</code></p>
<p>In CVL 2 the flag <code>--server</code> was added to replace <code>--staging</code> <code>--cloud</code> and to allow adding additional server platforms.
<code>--server</code> gets as a parameter the platform name.
<code>--prover_version</code> is a new flag in CVL 2 For setting the Branch/hot-fix</p>
