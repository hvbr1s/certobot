<h1>Loop Unrolling</h1>
<p>One of the approximations applied by the Certora Prover is loop unrolling.
Loops in the contract are replaced by multiple copies of their bodies.
if the Prover detects that a loop has a constant number of iterations, this loop is unrolled
as many times as the constant.</p>
<p>For example, for the loop:
<code>solidity
for (uint i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++)
        j++;
</code>
the Prover can determine that the loop always runs 3 times, so the loop will be replaced by
<code>solidity
j++;
j++;
j++;
</code>
If the Prover cannot easily determine the number of loop iterations, it will unroll it a fixed number of times. The default number is 1, but it can be configured using
the {ref}<code>--loop_iter</code> flag.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following solidity function:</p>
<p><code>solidity
/// @notice: `slow_copy(n)` always returns `n`
function slow_copy(uint n) returns uint {
    uint j = 0;
    for (uint i = 0; i &lt; n; i++)
        j++;
    return j;
}
</code></p>
<p>With <code>--loop_iter 2</code>, the loop in <code>slow_copy</code> will be approximated by two copies of its
body:</p>
<p>```solidity
function slow<em>copy</em>unrolled(uint n) returns uint {
    uint j = 0;</p>
<pre><code>uint i = 0;
if (i &lt; n) {
    j++;
    i++;
    if (i &lt; n) {
        j++;
        i++;
    }
}

return j;
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>If a particular example would cause the loop to run more than twice, then the
loop guard (<code>i &lt; n</code> in the example) would still be true at the end of the loop.</p>
<p>The Prover has two options for handling examples that would execute the loop
too many times:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In <strong>pessimistic mode</strong> (the default), the Prover will report an example
that executes the loop too many times as a violation of the "loop unwinding
condition" rule.  In pessimistic mode, any rule run on <code>slow_copy(n)</code> would
report a violation with <code>n = 3</code>.</p>
<p>Pessimistic mode is {term}<code>sound</code>, because there may be rule
violations in the original code that only occur when the loop runs more than
3 times, and loop unrolling would cause those violations to be missed.  For
example, the original function <code>slow_copy</code> should not satisfy the following rule:</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule bogus_rule(uint n) {
    assert slow_copy(n) &lt; 5, "slow_copy always returns something less than 5";
}
</code></p>
<p>but any violation would require 5 or more iterations of the loop.  The loop
unwinding violation notifies the user that this rule might not hold.</p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>optimistic mode</strong> (enabled by passing the {ref}<code>--optimistic_loop</code> option),
the Prover <em>ignores</em> any examples that would cause the loop to execute
too many times.  In optimistic mode, the rule <code>bogus_rule</code> above would be
reported as passing.</p>
<p><code>{caution}
Optimistic mode is {term}`unsound` since it may miss counterexamples like
these.  It should be used with care since it may hide bugs.
</code></p>
<p>Despite the unsoundness, optimistic mode is quite useful in practice.  For
example, it allows us to document that <code>slow_copy</code> satisfies the
specification given in its documentation:</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule slow_copy_correct(uint n) {
    assert slow_copy(n) == n, "slow_copy(n) always returns n";
}
</code></p>
<p>In optimistic mode, this rule will pass (as it should), but in pessimistic
mode it will fail if <code>n &gt; 2</code>.</p></li>
