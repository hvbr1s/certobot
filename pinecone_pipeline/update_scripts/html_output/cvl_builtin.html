<h1>Built-in Rules</h1>
<p>The Certora Prover has built-in general-purpose rules targeted at finding common
vulnerabilities.  These rules can be verified on a contract without writing any
contract-specific rules.</p>
<p>Built-in rules can be included in any spec file by writing <code>use builtin rule
&lt;rule-name&gt;;</code>.  This document describes the available built-in rules.</p>
<p><code>{contents}
</code></p>
<h2>Syntax</h2>
<p>The syntax for rules is given by the following <a href="ebnf-syntax">EBNF grammar</a>:</p>
<p>```
built<em>in</em>rule ::= "use" "builtin" "rule" built<em>in</em>rule_name ";"</p>
<p>built<em>in</em>rule_name ::=
    | "msgValueInLoopRule"
    | "hasDelegateCalls"
    | "sanity"
    | "deepSanity"
    | "viewReentrancy"
```</p>
<p>(built-in-msg-value-in-loop)=</p>
<h2>Bad loop detection — <code>msgValueInLoopRule</code></h2>
<p>Loops that <a href="https://trustchain.medium.com/ethereum-msg-value-reuse-vulnerability-5afd0aa2bcef">use <code>msg.value</code> or make delegate
calls</a> are a well-known source of security
vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>The <code>msgValueInLoopRule</code> detects these anti-patterns.  It can be enabled by
including
<code>cvl
use builtin rule msgValueInLoopRule;
</code>
in a spec file.  The rule will fail on any functions that can make delegate
calls or access <code>msg.value</code> inside a loop. This includes any functions that recursively call any functions that has
this vulnerability.</p>
<p>(built-in-has-delegate-calls)=</p>
<h2>Delegate call detection — <code>hasDelegateCalls</code></h2>
<p>The <code>hasDelegateCalls</code> built-in rule is a handy way to find delegate calls in
a contract. <a href="https://blog.solidityscan.com/security-issues-with-delegate-calls-4ae64d775b76">Contracts that use delegate calls</a> require proper security checking.</p>
<p>The <code>hasDelegateCalls</code> can be enabled by including
<code>cvl
use builtin rule hasDelegateCalls;
</code>
in a spec file.  Any functions that can make delegate calls will fail the
<code>hasDelegateCalls</code> rule.</p>
<p>(built-in-sanity)=</p>
<h2>Basic setup checks — <code>sanity</code></h2>
<p>The <code>sanity</code> rule checks that there is at least one non-reverting path through
each contract function.  It can be enabled by including
<code>cvl
use builtin rule sanity;
</code>
in a spec file.</p>
<p>The sanity rule is useful for two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It is an easy way to determine which contract functions take a long time to
analyze.  If a method takes a long time to verify the <code>sanity</code> rule (or
times out), it will almost certainly time out while verifying interesting
properties.  This can help you quickly discover which methods may need
{term}<code>summarization &lt;summary&gt;</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>A method the fails the <code>sanity</code> rule will revert on every input; every rule
that calls the method will therefore be {term}<code>vacuous &lt;vacuity&gt;</code>.  This
probably indicates a problem with the Prover configuration; the most likely
cause is {ref}<code>loop unrolling &lt;unrolling&gt;</code>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend running the sanity rule at the beginning of a project to
ensure that the Prover's configuration is reasonable.</p>
<p><code>{note}
The `sanity` built-in rule is unrelated to the {ref}`--rule_sanity` option;
the built-in rule is used to check the basic setup, while `--rule_sanity` checks
individual rules.
</code></p>
<h3>How <code>sanity</code> is checked</h3>
<p>The <code>sanity</code> rule is translated into the following {term}<code>parametric rule</code>:</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule sanity {
    method f; env e;
    calldataarg arg;
    f(e, arg); 
    satisfy true;
}
</code></p>
<p>To find a satisfying trace, the Prover must construct an input
for which <code>f</code> doesn't revert.</p>
<p>(built-in-deep-sanity)=</p>
<h2>Thorough complexity checks — <code>deepSanity</code></h2>
<p>The basic sanity rule only tries to find a <em>single</em> input that causes each
function to execute without reverting.  While this check can quickly identify
problems with the Prover setup, a successful <code>sanity</code> run does not guarantee
that the contract methods won't cause Prover timeouts, or that all of the
contract code is reachable.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following method:
<code>solidity
function veryComplexFunction() returns(uint) {
    uint x = 0;
    for (uint i = 0 ; i &lt; array.len; i++) {
        x = x + complexComputation(i);
    }
    return x;
}
</code></p>
<p>There is clearly a simple non-reverting path through the code: it will
immediately return if <code>array.len</code> is <code>0</code>; the basic <code>sanity</code> can quickly find a
{term}<code>model</code> like this without even considering the implementation of
<code>complexComputation</code>, so the <code>sanity</code> rule will succeed.  However, verifying
any property that depends on the return value of <code>veryComplexFunction</code> will
require the Prover to reason about <code>complexComputation()</code>, which may cause
timeouts.  Moreover, portions of <code>complexComputation</code> may be unreachable, and
this will not be caught by the basic <code>sanity</code> rule.</p>
<p>The <code>deepSanity</code> rule generalizes the basic <code>sanity</code> rule by heuristically
choosing interesting statements in the contract code and ensuring that there
are non-reverting {term}<code>models &lt;model&gt;</code> that execute those statements.  In the above
example, one of the paths chosen by <code>deepSanity</code> would go through the body of
the <code>for</code> loop, forcing the Prover to find a non-reverting path through the
<code>complexComputation</code> method.</p>
<p>The <code>deepSanity</code> rule heuristic favors the following program points:
1. The "if" and "else" branches of a code-heavy <code>if</code> statement
2. The beginning of an external call
3. The beginning of the program (this is the same as the usual sanity rule)</p>
<p>The <code>deepSanity</code> rule can be enabled by including
<code>cvl
use builtin rule deepSanity;
</code>
in a spec file.  You must also pass the {ref}<code>--multi_assert_check</code> flag to
the Prover.</p>
<p>The number of code points that are chosen can be configured with the
{ref}<code>-maxNumberOfReachChecksBasedOnDomination</code> flag; the default value is
<code>10</code>.</p>
<h3>How <code>deepSanity</code> is checked</h3>
<p>The <code>deepSanity</code> rule works similarly to the <code>sanity</code> rule; it adds an
additional variable <code>x_p</code> for each interesting program point <code>p</code>, and
instruments the contract code at <code>p</code> to set <code>x_p</code> to <code>true</code>.  The Prover then
tries to prove that <code>x_p</code> is false after executing the function.  To find a
counterexample; the Prover must construct a model that passes through <code>p</code>.</p>
<p>(built-in-view-reentrancy)=</p>
<h2>Read-only reentrancy detection — <code>viewReentrancy</code></h2>
<p>The <code>viewReentrancy</code>  built-in rule detects 
<a href="https://blog.pessimistic.io/read-only-reentrancy-in-depth-6ea7e9d78e85">read-only reentrancy vulnerabilities in a contract</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>viewReentrancy</code> rule can be enabled by including
<code>cvl
use builtin rule viewReentrancy;
</code>
in a spec file.  Any functions that have read-only reentrancy will fail the
<code>viewReentrancy</code> rule.</p>
<h3>How <code>viewReentrancy</code> is checked</h3>
<p>Reentrancy vulnerabilities can arise when a contract makes an external call with an inconsistent internal 
state. This behavior allows the receiver contract to make reentrant calls that exploit the inconsistency.</p>
<p>The <code>viewReentrancy</code> rule ensures that whenever a method <code>f</code> of {ref}<code>currentContract &lt;currentContract&gt;</code> makes an external call, 
the internal state of <code>currentContract</code> is equivalent to either (1) the state of <code>currentContract</code> at the beginning of the calling function,
or (2) the state of <code>currentContract</code> at the end of the calling function (by "equivalent", 
we mean that all view functions return the same values). 
This ensures that the external call cannot observe <code>currentContract</code> in any state that it couldn't have without being 
called from <code>currentContract</code>. </p>
