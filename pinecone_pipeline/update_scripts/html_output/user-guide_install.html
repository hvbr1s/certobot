<h2>Step 2: Install the Certora Prover package</h2>
<p><code>{tip}
It is always recommended to use a Python virtual environment,
such as [venv][venv] or [virtualenv][virtualenv],
when installing a Python package.
</code></p>
<p>Execute the following command at the terminal to install the Prover:</p>
<p><code>bash
pip3 install certora-cli
</code></p>
<p><code>{caution}
Note that the terminal may prompt you with a warning that some files, e.g.
python3.x, are not included in the `PATH`, and should be added. Add these files
to `PATH` to avoid errors.
</code></p>
<p>The following section presents some, but maybe not all, possible warnings that
can arise during installation and how to deal with them:</p>

     * Open a terminal and move to the :file:`etc/paths.d` directory from root:

       .. code-block:: bash

          cd /etc/paths.d

     * Use root privileges to create a file with an informative name such as
       ``PythonForProver``, and open it with your favorite text editor:

       .. code-block:: bash

          sudo nano PythonForProver

     * Write the specified path from the warning:

       .. code-block:: bash

          /specified/path/in/warning

     * If needed, more than one path can be added on a single file,
       just separate the path with a colon (``:``).

     * Quit the terminal to load the new addition to ``$PATH``,
       and reopen to check that the ``$PATH`` was updated correctly:

       .. code-block:: bash

          cd ~

     * open the .profile file with your favorite text editor:

       .. code-block:: bash

          nano .profile

     * Make sure to apply the changes to the ``$PATH`` by executing the script:

</code></p>
<p>(beta-install)=</p>
<h2>Installing the beta version (optional)</h2>
<p>If you wish to install a pre-release version, you can do so by installing
<code>certora-cli-beta</code> instead of <code>certora-cli</code>.  We do not recommend having both
packages installed simultaneously, so you should remove the <code>certora-cli</code>
package before installing <code>certora-cli-beta</code>:</p>
<p><code>sh
pip uninstall certora-cli
pip install certora-cli-beta
</code></p>
<p>If you wish to easily switch between the beta and the production versions, you
can use a <a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/">python virtual environment</a>:</p>
<p><code>sh
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv certora-beta
source certora-beta/bin/activate
pip3 install certora-cli-beta
</code></p>
<p>You can then switch to the standard CVL release by running <code>deactivate</code>, and
back to the beta release using <code>certora-beta/bin/activate</code>.</p>
<h2>Step 3: Set the personal access key as an environment variable</h2>
<p>The Certora Prover requires a personal access key. 
You can get a free personal access key by registering on the 
<a href="https://www.certora.com/signup?plan=prover">Certora website</a>.</p>
<p>Before running the Prover, 
you should register your access key as a system variable.
To do so on macOS or Linux machines, 
execute the following command on the terminal:</p>
<p><code>bash
export CERTORAKEY=&lt;personal_access_key&gt;
</code></p>
<p>This command sets a temporary variable that will be unset once the terminal is
closed. We recommended storing the access key in an environment variable named
<code>CERTORAKEY</code>. This way, you will no longer need to execute the above command
whenever you open a terminal. To set an environment variable permanently,
follow the next steps:</p>
<p>```{eval-rst}
.. tab-set::</p>
<p>.. tab-item:: macOS
      :sync: macos</p>
<pre><code>  * Open a terminal and make sure you're in the home directory:

       cd ~

  * Create a file with the name ``.zshenv`` and open it with your favorite text editor:

    .. code-block:: bash

       nano .zshenv

  * Write the export command from the beginning of step 3,
    save and quit (``ctrl+x`` on ``nano``).

  * You can make sure that the file was created correctly by
    seeing it listed on the directory or by opening it again with the text editor:

    .. code-block:: bash

       ls -a

    OR

    .. code-block:: bash

       nano .zshenv

  * Make sure to apply the environment variable you've just created by executing the script:

    .. code-block:: bash

       source .zshenv

  When running the Certora Prover in the Visual Studio Code Extension, you may need
  to restart VSCode or your computer.

       nano .profile

  * At the bottom of the file, under the ``PATH="..."`` insert 
    the export command from the beginning of step 3, save and quit (``ctrl+x`` on ``nano``).

  * You can make sure that the file was modified correctly by

<p>All users of the Certora Prover can access the tool using the command line 
interface, or <a href="https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/prover/cli/index.html">CLI</a>. 
Those who use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code editor (VS Code) also have the 
option of using the

     * Open a terminal and make sure you're in the home directory:

       .. code-block:: bash

          cd ~

     * open the .profile file with your favorite text editor:

       .. code-block:: bash

          nano .profile

     * At the bottom of the file, add to ``PATH="..."`` the full
       path to the directory that contains the `solc` executables.
       To add an additional path just separate with a colon (``:``) :

       .. code-block:: bash

          PATH="$PATH:/full/path/to/solc/executable/folder"

     * You can make sure that the file was modified correctly by opening
       it again with the text editor:

       .. code-block:: bash

          nano .profile

     * Make sure to apply the changes to the ``$PATH`` by executing the script:

       .. code-block:: bash

          source .profile
