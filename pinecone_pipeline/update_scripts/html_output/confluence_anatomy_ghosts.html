<h1>Ghosts</h1>
<h2>What are ghosts?</h2>
<p>At their core, ghosts are just {ref}<code>uninterpreted functions &lt;uninterp-functions&gt;</code>. These uninterpreted functions by themselves wouldn't really be "ghosts" per se. However, along with <strong>axioms</strong> and <strong>hooks</strong>, these uninterpreted functions can be used to model some contract state that isn't explicitly in the contract (hence it is a “ghost” state). In our canonical example, we use ghosts to keep track of the sum of balances in a bank contract.</p>
<h2>A Simple Bank Example</h2>
<p>Consider the following <code>Bank</code> contract:</p>
<p>```solidity
contract Bank {
  mapping (address =&gt; uint256) balances;
  uint256 public totalSupply;</p>
<p>function deposit(address a, uint256 amount) public {
    // also prevents overflow on account[a].balance, since that's &lt;= totalSupply
    require(totalSupply + amount &gt;= amount);
    balances[a] += amount;
    totalSupply += amount;
  }</p>
<p>function withdraw(address a, uint256 amount) public {
    require(balances[a] &gt;= amount);
    balances[a] -= amount;
    totalSupply -= amount;
  }</p>
<p>function payday(address[] memory payees) public {
    for (uint i = 0; i &lt; payees.length; i++) {
      deposit(payees[i], 1);
    }
  }
}
```</p>
<p>The state of the contract consists of <code>totalSupply</code> and <code>balances</code> where <code>balances</code> keeps track of the balance in each account and <code>totalSupply</code> keeps track of the sum of all balances. Now let's suppose that we don't trust that <code>totalSupply</code>gets updated correctly. We can introduce a ghost function to keep track of the sum and then compare that ghost function with <code>totalSupply</code> to see if they both got updated as expected. Here's what that looks like:</p>
<p>```cvl
// declare the ghost function
ghost ghostSupply() returns uint256;
// the hook that updates the ghost function as follows
// "At every write to the value at key 'a' in 'balances'
// increase ghostTotalSupply by the difference between
// tho old value and the new value"
//                              the new value ↓ written:
hook Sstore balances[KEY address a] uint256 balance
// the old value ↓ already there
    (uint256 old<em>balance) {
  havoc ghostSupply assuming ghostSupply@new() == ghostSupply@old() +
      (balance - old</em>balance);
}</p>
<p>rule totalSupplyInvariant(method f) {
  require totalSupply() == ghostSupply();
  calldataarg arg;
  env e;
  sinvoke f(e, arg);
  assert totalSupply() == ghostSupply();
}
```</p>
<p>There are a few things going on here.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>We declared <code>ghost ghostSupply() returns uint256</code>. This creates an uninterpreted function called <code>ghostSupply</code>that takes 0 arguments and returns a <code>uint256</code>. Notice that this is in a global scope. Each rule will get its own version of this uninterpreted function, but this way, it doesn't have to be written several times.</p></li>
<li><p>We declared a <code>hook</code>. This hook tells the tool to analyze the rule and find every <code>Sstore</code> (write) to an entry in <code>balances</code>. It binds the <em>stored value</em> to the name <code>balance</code> and the <em>old value</em> to the name <code>old_balance</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>We defined a <em>ghost update</em> inside the <em>body</em> of the hook. We used a <code>havoc
assuming</code> statement to mutate the ghost function. The <code>havoc
assuming</code> statement --- in this case <code>havoc ghostSupply
assuming</code> binds <code>ghostSupply@new()</code>, the havoced version,
and <code>ghostSupply@old()</code> the previous version. <code>ghostSupply</code> does not exist
to the right of <code>assuming</code>. We then constrain the new version in terms of
the old.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>When all of these work in conjunction, the Prover successfully proves the rule <code>totalSupplyInvariant</code>.</p>
