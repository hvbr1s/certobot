<h1>Producing Positive Examples</h1>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to produce examples of an expected behavior instead of
counterexamples that demonstrate unexpected behavior.  You can do this by
writing a rule that uses {ref}<code>satisfy</code> instead of the <code>assert</code> command.  For
each <code>satisfy</code> command in a rule, the Prover will produce an example that makes
the condition true, or report an error.</p>
<p>The purpose of the <code>satisfy</code> statement is to produce examples that demonstrate
some execution of the code.  Not every example is interesting — users
should inspect the example to ensure that it demonstrates the expected
behavior.</p>
<p>For {clink}<code>example &lt;/DEFI/ConstantProductPool/certora/spec/ConstantProductPool.spec&gt;</code>,
we may be interested in showing that it is
possible for someone to deposit some assets into a pool and then immediately
withdraw them.  The following rule demonstrates this scenario:</p>
<p><code>{cvlinclude} ../../Examples/DEFI/ConstantProductPool/certora/spec/ConstantProductPool.spec
:cvlobject: possibleToFullyWithdraw
:caption: Positive example
</code></p>
<p>The Prover will produce an example that satisfies this condition.
Sometimes the example will be uninteresting, such as having
{cvl}<code>amount == 0</code> in the example for {cvl}<code>possibleToFullyWithdraw</code>.
In such cases we need to strengthen the conditions in order
to produce more interesting examples.
In {cvl}<code>possibleToFullyWithdraw</code> we added a
{cvl}<code>require amount &gt; 0;</code> statement to prevent such a case.</p>
<p>Alternatively, we could have strengthened the {cvl}<code>satisfy</code>
condition by adding</p>
<p><code>cvl
    satisfy (amount &gt; 0) &amp;&amp; ...
</code></p>
