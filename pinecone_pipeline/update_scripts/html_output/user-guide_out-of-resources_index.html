<h1>Managing Timeouts and Out of Memory Problems</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we describe how to diagnose and remedy when the Certora Prover
ran out of time or out of memory.</p>
<p>Out-of-memory problems are signified by an <code>Extremely low available memory</code>
message in the Global Problems tab of the Prover reports, see
{ref}<code>memout-introduction</code> for more details. Timeouts are signified either by a
<code>Global timeout reached</code> message in the Global Problems tab, if the whole Prover
job timed out, or by an orange clock symbol next to the rule, if that
particular rule timed out, see {ref}<code>timeouts-introduction</code> for more details.</p>
