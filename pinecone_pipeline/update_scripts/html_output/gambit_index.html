<h1>Gambit: Mutation Generator for Solidity</h1>
<p>This chapter describes how Certora uses ideas from
mutation testing to evaluate and improve CVL specifications.</p>
<p>Mutation testing is a technique for evaluating and improving
  test suites.
Mutants are identical copies of the tested program with a single random change.
The objective is to assess how well a test suite can identify and detect faulty
 logic in these mutants.
The more mutants a test suite detects, or <em>kills</em>, the better the test suite is.
<em>Live</em> mutants --- those that pass all tests in the test suite --- are indications
  of potential shortcomings in the test suite and can be used as test goals to
  improve the test suite.</p>
<p>At Certora, we use mutation testing to evaluate and
  improve formal specifications used in automated verification.
We built <a href="https://github.com/Certora/gambit">Gambit</a>,
  an open-source mutation generator for Solidity.
We use the mutants generated by Gambit to assess the CVL specifications
  written for a verification task.
Gambit is a general-purpose mutation generation tool that can be used with many
  kinds of verifiers or testing tools. 
{doc}<code>mutation-verifier</code> describes how to use Gambit with the Certora Prover to 
  evaluate specifications, 
  while {doc}<code>gambit</code> describes how Gambit can be used to generate mutants for use with any tool.</p>
