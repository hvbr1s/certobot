<h1>Prover Approximations</h1>
<p>In order to check programs in an acceptable amount of time, the Prover
simplifies the code being verified. This section describes the mechanisms for
simplification.</p>

The approximations described in this section may be
{term}`underapproximation`s, meaning that they can cause real bugs to be
overlooked by the Prover.
