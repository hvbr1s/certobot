<h2>Two State Context</h2>
<p>A two-state context is a scope in which two versions of a variable or ghost function are available, representing <em>two different</em> states of that variable/ghost function. If we are talking about the variable <code>my_var</code> then the <em>old</em> version would be accessed using <code>my_var@old</code>, and the new version would be accessed using <code>my_var@new</code>. For ghost functions, we annotate the ghost application. For example, an application of the <em>old</em> version might look like <code>my_ghost@old(x, y)</code>, and an application of the <em>new</em> version might look like <code>my_ghost@new(x, y)</code> .</p>
<p>But how is it that we would have <em>two</em> versions of a variable or ghost function? Currently, the <em>only</em> place that will <em>create</em>these two versions is a havoc-assuming statement.</p>
<h3>Havoc Assuming</h3>
<p>Sometimes we want to forget everything we know about a variable and allow it to take any value from a certain program point onward. This is when we <em>havoc</em> a variable. For example:</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule my_rule(uint256 x) {
  require x == 2;
  assert x == 2; // passes
  havoc x;
  assert x == 2; // fails
}
</code></p>
<p>Other times, we'd only like to forget certain things about a variable or ghost function, and sometimes we'd like to learn <em>new</em> things or constrain a variable based on its own value. This is where the <code>havoc assuming</code> statement becomes very useful. The following example should illustrate the idea:</p>
<p><code>cvl
rule my_rule(uint256 x) {
  require x &gt;= 2;
  havoc x assuming x@new &gt; x@old;
  assert x &gt; 2; // passes
}
</code></p>
<p>and a <code>havoc assuming</code> statement with a ghost function might look like the following:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost contains(uint256 x) returns bool;</p>
<p>rule my_rule(uint256 x, uint256 y, uint256 z) {
  require contains(x);
  // "every input that used to return true should still return true
  //  AND y should now return true as well"
  havoc contains assuming contains@new(y) &amp;&amp;
      forall uint256 a. contains@old(a) =&gt; contains@new(a);</p>
<p>assert contains(x) &amp;&amp; contains(y); // passes
  assert contains(z);                // fails
}
```</p>
<p>Finally, as shown in the section on definitions, a definition with ghosts in two-state form may be used inside the two-state context of a <code>havoc assuming</code> statement.</p>
<h2>A Hook that Modifies Ghost State</h2>
<p>Above we saw an example where we made sure that the ghost state matched a read of its corresponding concrete state. This did not modify the ghost state but rather <em>further constrained</em> it according to new information. But when the concrete state is changed, we need some way to modify the ghost state. Suppose we have an update to a balance. We can use a <code>havoc assuming</code> statement to assume that all balances not concerned by the update stay the same and that the balance of the account that was changed gets updated:</p>
<p>```cvl
ghost ghostBalances(address) returns uint256;</p>
<p>hook Sstore balances[KEY address account] uint256 v {
  havoc ghostBalances assuming ghostBalances@new(account) == v &amp;&amp;
    forall address a. a != account =&gt;
        ghostBalances@new(a) == ghostBalances@old(a);
}
```</p>
<p><code>{caution}
In `Sstore` hooks, the old value is read by means of generating an `Sload`. However, any hook that can be matched to the generated `Sload` _does not_ apply within the `Sstore` hook.
