<h1>Checking Specifications</h1>
<p>Effective formal verification relies on accurate specifications. A flaw in the specification could lead to critical bugs slipping through undetected. Certora offers a set of tools to enhance the accuracy of specifications and identify potential issues. This chapter outlines these tools and demonstrates their application.</p>
<h2>Detecting Vacuous Specifications</h2>
<p>A vacuous statement is one that is technically true but lacks meaningful content. Consider the following example:</p>
<p><strong>Contract:</strong>
<code>solidity
function balanceOf(address account, uint256 id) public view override returns (uint256) {
    require(account != address(0), "account is zero");
    return _balances[id][account];
}
</code></p>
<p><strong>Specification:</strong>
```cvl
rule held<em>token</em>should_exist{
    address user;
    uint256 token;
    require balanceOf(0, token) == 0;</p>
<pre><code>require balanceOf(user, token) &lt;= totalSupplyOf(token);
assert balanceOf(user, token) &gt; 0 =&gt; token_exists(token);
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>The specification contains a flaw; the statement <code>balanceOf(0, token) == 0;</code> will always revert due to the <code>require</code> in the contract, resulting in an empty starting state. To address such issues, Certora allows to run <a href="https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/prover/checking/sanity.html?highlight=rule%20sanity#sanity-vacuity">Vacuity checks</a>. These checks append <code>assert false</code> to each rule, exposing vacuously proven assumptions. This ensures that every rule in the specification has at least one input that reaches all the assertions. It is a useful check, but nevertheless, it is not a good measure for coverage.

<p><em>Note: Vacuity in real-world examples often arises from combinations of requirements, not just isolated statements.</em></p>
<h2>Identifying Tautology Specifications</h2>
<p>Tautology, a special case of vacuity known as the "vacuous assertion," occurs when a statement is always true regardless of the system's state. An example is provided below:</p>
<p>```cvl
rule something<em>is</em>always<em>transferred{
    address receiver;
    uint256 balance</em>before_transfer = balanceOf(receiver);
    require balanceOf(receiver) == 0;</p>
<pre><code>uint256 amount;
require amount &gt; 0;

transfer(receiver, amount);
uint256 balance_after_transfer = balanceOf(receiver);
assert balanceOf(receiver) &lt;= balance_after_transfer;
</code></pre>
<p>}
```</p>
<p>In this case, the <code>assert</code> statement is always true since it compares equal values, neglecting any meaningful checks related to the transfer behavior. Certora allows to run <a href="https://docs.certora.com/en/latest/docs/prover/checking/sanity.html?highlight=rule%20sanity#assert-tautology-checks">Assert tautology checks</a> to address such instances. By removing preconditions and operations, these checks focus solely on the <code>assert</code> statement, revealing whether it is always true regardless of the process being examined.</p>
